Doorstep Delivery
[It is nighttime in Surrey, we see two owls on the street sign "PRIVET DRIVE" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. One the owls fly away to reveal a elderly man with crimson robes, and the long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks through a forest near the street. He takes out his deliminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.]

Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
[The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. We see that the cat's shadow progressing into a woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGongall is revealed.]

McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
McGonagall: And the boy?
Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.
McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
Dumbledore: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid, takes off his goggles.]

Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
[Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.]

McGonagall: Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are...
Dumbledore: The only family he has.
[They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.]

McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
[Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat.]

Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.
[Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door.]

Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.
[The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.]

The Vanishing Glass
[The scar's glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs]
Petunia: Up. Get up. [She knocks on his closet door repeatedly] Now! [Smacks door of closet and walks into the living room]
[Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.]

Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
[Harry looks up to the join works of the stairs with small amounts of dusts rising. Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. Harry tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley. Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.]

Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
Vernon: Happy birthday, son.
[Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in outgrown clothes.]

Petunia: [to Harry, unpleasantly] Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.
[Harry then gets to work on cooking the bacon]

Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
Vernon: [to Harry, who is taking his time placing the bacon on the plates] Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!
Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.
[Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.]

Petunia: Aren’t they wonderful, darling?
Dudley: How many are there?
Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!
Vernon: Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year.
Dudley: I don't care how big they are!
Petunia: [calming him down] Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?
[Outside the house morning. The happy family is heading to the car.]

Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
[Harry then goes to go in the car, but Vernon stops him, pointing his keys at him.]

Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.
[At the London Zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large Boa constructor.]
Dudley: Make it move.
[Vernon taps the glass of the cage.]

Vernon: Move!
[Dudley taps the glass much harder, and Vernon nervously winces.]
Dudley: MOVE!
Harry: He's asleep!
Dudley: He's boring.
[Dudley and his parents head over to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.]

Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you. [The snake looks up and blinks.] Can you...hear me? [The snake nods] It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? [The snake shakes its head] You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? [The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity] I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
[The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He comes over to the glass, knocking Harry to the floor.]

Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
[Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. With his back turned, Harry glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears, causing Dudley to wretch forward, losing his balance.]

Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
[Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. Harry snickers at what he saw. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.]

Snake: Thanks.
Harry: Anytime.
[The snake slivers off to the exit.]

Man: SNAKE!
[There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. Seeing that he is now trapped, he pounds the glass in panic.]

Dudley: Mum, mummy!
Petunia: [notices him in the exhibit] AHH!
Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!
Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!
[Harry grins and snickers, Vernon notices this and glares down at him. Harry's grin disappears, knowing that he is in trouble with Vernon.]

Letters from No One
[Back at the Dursleys'. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.]

Petunia: [assuring a distressed Dudley] It's all right. It's all right.
[They walk in the living room. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.]

Harry: Ow!
Vernon: What happened?!
Harry: I swear I don't know! [Vernon snarls] One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
[Vernon scoffs at this, shoves Harry in the cupboard under the stairs and slams the door]

Vernon: There's no such thing as magic! [he blackens out the vent on the door]
[An owl flies into view and lands itself on a TV aerial on one of the houses' roof]

(Extended Version)

[The camera slowly pans up to reveal Dudley in his smartest school uniform, posing and smiling grandly.]

Petunia: Awww, smile. [She takes a photograph of him. She gasps in joy.] Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.
Vernon: Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life.
Harry: Will I have to wear that, too?
[They draw their attention to Harry]

Petunia: What, you? Go to Smeltings? [Harry nods, questionably]
Vernon: Ha!
[They laugh in amusement]

Petunia: Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong. [Goes to the kitchen and fishes out a grey shirt in a boiler.] And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.
Harry: But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
Petunia: It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post. [Harry then heads to the hallway] Go!
(Normal Version)

[Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept. Uncle Vernon and Dudley sit at the table while Aunt Petunia is busy fixing breakfast. Harry walks in with the mail and hands it to Uncle Vernon, then walks to his seat with his letter.]

Vernon: [after reading a postcard] Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk.
[Dudley suddenly notices Harry's letter and runs to grab it from him and give it to his father.]

Dudley: Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!
Vernon: Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
[The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps. Much later, another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up. In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.]

Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.
[Harry quietly closes the cupboard door. The next day, Vernon and Petunia are outside the door. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.]

Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
[She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.]

Vernon: Shoo! Go on!
[She notices something and pats Vernon on the shoulder to get his attention, and what they see is more letters addressed to Harry.]

(Extended Version)

[Later, Petunia is cracking a egg into a bowl, and what instead comes out is a folded-up letter. She cracks another one, but another letter comes out as well. She then cracks yet another one, but the same happens again. She stares at the letter, and then she hears the owls screeching. She draws her attention to the outside of the window, and what she sees is four owls sitting on some garden chairs. Petunia then screams and runs off.]

(Normal Version)

[Much later, Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in. The scene fades to the next day, the family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.]

Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?
Harry: [when Dudley shrugs and didn't answer, as Harry hands a cookie to Vernon] Because there's no post on Sunday?
Vernon: Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one. [Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.] No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-
[As Vernon was talking, a letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernon's face, cutting him off. There is a rumbling and then millions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace. The family shrieks in horror as Harry watches in amazement.]

Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! [He jumps on Petunia's lap as she and Vernon continue screaming]
Vernon: Go away, ahh!
Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
[Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.]

Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!
[He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.]

Harry: Get off! Ahh!
[Vernon restrains Harry as several letters begin to shoot everywhere around the house.]

Vernon: Ahh!
Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!
[The wood plank nailed in front of the letterbox finally breaks from the excess pressure of the letters shooting through the letter.]

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!
[Petunia watches with a horrified look on her face, knowing that Dudley may be right.]

Keeper of the Keys
[That stormy night, a tall house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The Dursleys, including Harry have moved there, due to the chaos with the letters. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor and Dudley sleeping on a sofa. Harry has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.]

Harry: [to himself] Make a wish, Harry. [he blows the "candles" on the drawn birthday cake]
[Suddenly, the door thumps, in sync with the thunder flashing. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Harry hides behind a wall, and Dudley cowers on a windowsill. Petunia and Vernon appear, with Vernon holding a double barrel gun.]

Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!
[The door bangs again and then falls down, and a giant man appears. As he comes into the clear lighting, he is revealed to be Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Sorry 'bout that. [He puts the door back up]
Vernon: [aiming his gun at him] I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
[As Petunia quietly gasps in fear, Hagrid grabs the gun and bends it upwards.]

Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. [The gun fires upwards, blasting a hole in the ceiling, causing the two to shriek in fear. Hagrid notices Dudley.] Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.
[Harry reveals himself]

Harry: I-I am.
Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. [Hands Harry the cake] Words and all. Heh.
[Harry opens cake, which reads "Happee Birdae Harry" in green frosting.]

Harry: Thank you!
Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?
[Hagrid sits down on the sofa, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gasps.]

Harry: [puts cake down] Excuse me, who are you?
Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
Harry: Sorry, no.
Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
Harry: Learned what?
Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.
[Harry looks confused]

Harry: I-I'm a what?
Hagrid: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.
Hagrid: Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? [Harry softens his expression] Ah.
[Dudley whimpers. Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.]

Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Vernon: [to Hagrid] He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!
Harry: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you.
Harry: [to Petunia, angrily] Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
Petunia: We had to tell him something.
Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
[As the Dursleys argue with Hagrid, no one, including Harry, is noticing Dudley taking Harry's cake away]

Vernon: He'll not be going!
Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
Harry: Muggle?
Hagrid: [to Harry, calmly] Non magic folk. [he immediately draws his attention back to Vernon and Petunia in anger] This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! [As Hagrid was talking, Dudley was munching on Harry's cake.] He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.
[Harry smiles upon hearing Dumbledore's name]

Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
[Hagrid whips out his umbrella and points it at Vernon, threateningly.]

Hagrid: Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me.
[Hagrid finally sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and aims his umbrella at his rear. He fires a magic spark at it, causing a grey tail to grow.]

Dudley: Ahh!
[The Dursleys shriek in both fright and horror, as they run off out of sight. Harry laughs at this, so does Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
Harry: [Nods] Okay.
Hagrid: [checks his pocket-watch] Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. [he goes off to the door and pulls it down again, before stepping out. He turns to Harry] Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?
[He walks out. Harry grins, looks back at the direction where the Dursleys are gone, and grins again, before grabbing his jacket and joins Hagrid on their journey to London.]

Diagon Alley
[The next day, in the streets of London.]

(Extended Version)

[Harry and Hagrid are in the underground tube.]

Harry: [reading the list] First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand. [He turns to Hagrid]
Hagrid: Essential bit of equipment, Harry.
Harry: One pair of dragon-hide gloves. [he turns to Hagrid again] Hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon?
Hagrid: Well, they don't mean for a penguin, do they? Heh. Crikey, but not a dragon.
Harry: But you like a dragon?
Hagrid: Fast and misunderstood beasts, Harry. Fast and misunderstood. [He suddenly eyes a woman and then he nods. The woman returns to reading her paper.]
(Normal Version)

[The next scene, Hagrid and Harry are walking down the streets.]

Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Could we find all this in London?
Hagrid: If you know where to go.
[They walk towards a corner store and as they get closer, the sign above it has “The Leaky Cauldron” magically appearing. They enter the Leaky Cauldron. There was music and several patrons that are speaking to each other.]

Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.
Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.
[The pub immediately goes silent and everyone notices. A man comes up and shakes Harry's hand.]

Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.
[A witch comes up and shakes Harry's hand, as well.]

Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
[A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is Professor Quirrell.]

Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. [puts out his hand, offering a handshake with Quirrell. But he looks at Harry's head and hesitatingly refuses]
Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.
Harry: Goodbye.
[The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.]

Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!
Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. [Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks then magically shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street called Diagon Alley.] Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley. [Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.] Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
[Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.]

Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, it’s the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet. [the camera pans to see the broom's model name on the handle]
Gringotts
[Harry and Hagrid continue walking down Diagon Alley]

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.
Hagrid: Well, there's your money, Harry. [he points to a tall, white, marble building, Gringotts Bank] Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.
[Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working at their desks.]
Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins, but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. [Harry sticks to him. Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin, wearing spectacles and a waistcoat, in it.] Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
[The goblin looks up.]

Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. There's the little devil. [Whispers] Oh, and there's something else as well. [Takes out a letter wrapped in a string.] Professor Dumbledore gave me this. [Hagrid hands the Goblin the letter.] It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which.
Goblin: Very well.
[Later, they race down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin called Griphook, clambers out.]

Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. [Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault] Key please.
[Hagrid hands him the key and Griphook unlocks the vault. The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.]

Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing now, did ya?
[They continue on through the cavern.]

Griphook: Vault 713.
Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?
Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Griphook: Stand back. [Slides finger down the door. The vault opens to reveal a small white stone package. Hagrid enters the vault and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.]
Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.
[Harry nods in agreement]

Ollivanders
[Outside back in Diagon Alley, Harry and Hagrid are walking through the street. Harry has bought most of his equipment, and is reading his list.]

Harry: I still need...a wand.
Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. [he points to the store] No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
[Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands in boxes, but no people.]

Harry: [Softly] Hello? Hello?
[Then, a nose came from the back, and a man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. The man is Ollivander and he smiles.]

Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. [Picks a wand] Ah. Here we are. [Harry holds it, but does nothing] Well, give it a wave. [Harry is hesitant, but waves. This causes most of the boxes to come flying out and crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter. ] Apparently not. [Gets another wand from a box.] Perhaps this. [Harry waves at a vase, which shatters, startling Harry.] No, no, definitely not! No matter... [gets a wand from a box, but stops and becomes thoughtful] I wonder. [Ollivander hands the wand to Harry. No sooner after he touched it, Harry suddenly glows under it, blowing his hair up and several of the paperwork in the background. Ollivander looked a bit surprised and deep in thought.] Curious, very curious.
Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?
Ollivander: [examining the wand he gave to Harry] I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. [Points to the lighting bolt scar on Harry's forehead]
Harry: And...who owned that wand?
Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. [he hands Harry back his wand.]
[Harry then hears a knock on the window.]

Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! [Has a snowy owl in a cage, which hoots, her name is Hedwig.]
Harry: [amazed] Wow.
The Boy Who Lived
[Later back in the Leaky Cauldron, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup. Everything is too quiet, Hagrid soon notices this.]

Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.
Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.
Hagrid: [sighs and pushes his bowl away] First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago, there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?
Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. [quietly] Voldemort.
Harry: Voldemort?
Hagrid: Shh!!
[Harry looks around to see if anyone heard it]

Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. [We flash over to a flashback on the night at Godric's hollow, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.] Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. [Harry's mother, Lily, screams in pain as she is killed by Voldemort's wand. Green flashes are seen from the windows outside the house. Then, we see Voldemort pointing his wand at an infant Harry Potter's head.] Nobody...not one. ‘Cept you.
[We flash back to the present time.]

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?
Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
Harry: What happened to...to You-Know-Who?
Hagrid: Well, some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why everybody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.
Platform 9¾
[King's Cross Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry, with his cart of his baggage, equipment and Hedwig, walk beside Hagrid. A couple look at Hagrid, suspiciously.]

Hagrid: What're you looking at? [He then checks watch] Blimey, is that the time? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his- well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. [hands the train ticket] Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.
[Harry looks at his ticket.]

Harry: Platform 9¾? But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9¾. There's no such thing...is there? [Harry looks up, but we now see that Hagrid has vanished and Harry all alone with his cart.]
[Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.]

Man: Sorry.
[Harry sees a guard.]

Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.
Guard: Right on your left, ma'am.
Harry: Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9¾?
Guard: [incredulous] 9¾? Think you're being funny, do ya? [he walks off]
[Harry then notices a woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.]

Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.
Harry: Muggles?
Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.
[A tall boy with red hair, called Percy, comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.]

Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.
George: He's not Fred, I am!
Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother.
Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.
[Fred moves towards the wall]

Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. [He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother. Harry shakes his head in disbelief.]
Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to-
Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. [pan to a red haired boy, called Ron, who smiles] Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Ginny: Good luck.
[Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station at Platform 9¾ with a red train, which is the Hogwarts Express, and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.]

Ron and Hermione
[Later on, the Hogwarts Express is travelling through the countryside. Harry is in sitting alone in a train compartment, and Ron appears in the doorway.]

Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.
Harry: No, not at all.
Ron: [sits across from Harry] I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.
Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
[Ron goes agape.]

Ron: So-so it's true? I mean, do you really have the...the...
Harry: The what?
Ron: [whispers] Scar...?
Harry: Oh [lifts up his hair bangs to reveal it]
Ron: Wicked.
[A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.]

Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?
Ron: [Holds up his mushed sandwiches] No, thanks, I'm all set. [smacks lips.]
Harry: We'll take the lot! [pulls out coins]
Ron: Whoa!
[A bit later, Harry and Ron are not sitting together eating bundles of sweets. Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over his head.]

Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
[Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.]

Harry: [picks up a blue and gold package] These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?
Ron: It's just a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself. [Harry opens the package, and a chocolate frog jumps onto the window and climbs up.] Watch it! [The frog reaches the open gap in the window, and jumps out.] Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
Harry: [seeing Dumbledore's image in the card] I got Dumbledore!
Ron: I got about 6 of him.
[Harry looks at the card again, but Dumbledore has vanished.]

Harry: Hey, he's gone!
Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? [Scabbers squeaks] This is Scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he?
Harry: A little.
Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Harry: Yeah!
Ron: [clears throat] Ahem. Sun-
[A girl called Hermione Granger, with bushy brown hair, dressed in robes, appears at the doorway.]

Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.
Ron: No.
Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Ron: [clears throat again] Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!
[He zaps Scabbers, but nothing happens. Ron shrugs.]

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example... [Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her wand at his glasses and Harry tenses] Oculus Reparo. [The tape on the nose-band vanishes, repairing his glasses as if they were good as new. Harry takes them off, amazed.] That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?
Ron: [with his mouth full] I'm...Ron Weasley.
Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. [Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.] You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. [Points to the dirt mark on Ron's nose. Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.]
Welcome to Hogwarts
[It is nighttime at Hogsmeade station, the train blows its whistle and pulls into outside the station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People, in their robes, begin pouring out of the train.]

Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!
[Harry and Ron, now in their robes, walk up to Hagrid.]

Hagrid: Hello, Harry.
Harry: Hey, Hagrid.
Ron: Whoaa!
Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.
[Later, a large number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle, known as the Hogwarts Castle, can be seen. People are in awe.]

Ron: Wicked.
[They continue on further towards the castle. Later on, the first year students walk in the castle, and up the staircase. As the camera pans, we see on a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She taps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.]

McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Now while you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.
[A scared looking boy called Neville Longbottom, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.]

Neville: Trevor! [he catches his toad; McGonagall stares down at him as some of the students laugh] Sorry. [He backs away, embarrassed.]
McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. [she leaves to go into the Great Hall]
[A young evil looking boy, with short blonde hair, called Draco Malfoy, speaks up.]

Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. [some of the students are heard whispering, "Harry Potter?" Draco introduces his two friends.] This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. [Ron snickers at his name] Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well, soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. [extends his hand to Harry.]
Harry: [not going to take Draco's arrogance] I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.
[Draco glares. McGonagall returns and taps Draco on the shoulder with a paper. He leaves Harry with one last glare.]

McGonagall: We're ready for you now. Follow me.
The Sorting Hat
[She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with thousands of students, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.]

Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.
[McGonagall leads the first-years to the front where the Sorting Hat lies on the stool.]

McGonagall: Will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
[Dumbledore rises from the main table.]

Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch [shows a ragged old man, called Mr. Argus Filch, with his cat with red eyes, called Mrs. Norris.] has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.[He sits back down]
McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.
Hermione: [to herself] Oh, no. Okay, relax. [She goes up]
Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.
[Harry nods in agreement. Hermione sits on the stool and McGonagall places the sorting hat on her head]

Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!
[The students cheer; Hermione jumps off with a smile.]

McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.
[Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Draco's head.]

Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!
[The students cheer, not as loudly]

Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
McGonagall: Susan Bones.
[A small, redhead goes up. Harry looks around and notices a black greasy haired, pale man, called, Severus Snape, giving him sinister looks. His scar hurts.]

Harry: Ahh! [puts his hand on his forehead in pain]
Ron: [concerned] Harry, what is it?
Harry: Nothing... nothing, I'm fine.
Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!
McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.
[Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.]

Sorting Hat: Ha! Another Weasley. I know just what to do with you... Gryffindor!!
[The students cheer as Ron sighs in relief.]

McGonagall: Harry Potter.
[Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down on the stool. The Sorting Hat is placed on his head.]

Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?
Harry: [whispering to the hat] Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. It’s all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness! There's no doubt about that. No?
Harry [still whispering] Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin.
Sorting Hat: Well, if you're sure... better be... GRYFFINDOR!!
[There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.]

Fred and George: We got Potter! We got Potter!
[Harry sits down at the table. He looks at Dumbledore, who lifts up his goblet and slightly waves it, as if he was wishing congratulations.]

Nick and Other Residents
[Later, all of the first years are sorted in their houses, all of the students were talking to each other. McGonagall dings on a cup.]

McGonagall: Your attention, please.
Dumbledore: [rising from his chair] Let the feast...begin.
[From the aerial view of the Great Hall, food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.]

Harry: Wow.
[Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in. Ron stuffs his face.]

Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
[Neville laughs. Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.]

Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
Harry: What's he teach?
Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrell’s job for years.
[Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghost, called Sir Nicolas, pops out.]

Ron: Ahh!
Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
[Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.]

Bloody Baron: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Girl: Look, it’s the Bloody Baron!
Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?
Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. [Begins to leave]
Ron: I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!
Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
Nick: Like this. [Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.]
Ron: Ahh!
[Hermione moans in disgust; Harry just simply rolls his eyes. Nick reattaches his head back to his body. Later, Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircase tower.]

Percy: Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep up. Thank you.
Boy: Ravenclaws, follow me. This way.
Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.
[The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.]

Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on.
[They begin walking up the stairs, several of the portraits began greeting them]

Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!
Ron: Look at that one, Harry!
Harry: I think she fancies you.
Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?
Man in a painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.
Girl: Who's that?
[A bit later on the seventh floor, They are in the corridor leading to Gryffindor Tower. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress. She is known as "The Fat Lady".]

The Fat Lady: Password?
Percy: Caput Draconis. [The Fat Lady smiles and nods in confirmation. The painting opens up to reveal a doorway in the wall, leading to Gryffindor Tower.] Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.
Girl: Oh, wow.
Percy: [Inside the common room] Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boy's dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
[Later at midnight. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content, knowing that he will love it here at Hogwarts.]

Potions and Parcels
[It is morning at Hogwarts, Harry and Ron are running in the corridors, because they are late for Transfiguration class. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk. Harry and Ron rush in; Hermione rolls her eyes in annoyance because they're late for class.]

Ron: Whew, we made it. Can you imagine the look on McGonagall's face if we were late?
[The cat jumps off the desk and transforms into Professor McGonagall, on-screen for the first time. The two boys are amazed.]

Ron: That was bloody brilliant.
McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Perhaps if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time.
Harry: We got lost.
McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
[Later on, inside Snape's potions classroom, the students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.]

Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few... [looks at Draco, who smiles] who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper... [Draco looks on] in death. [Draco raises his eyebrows. Snape sees Harry, writing what Snape said in his lecture down, in, his view, not paying attention.] Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention. [Hermione nudges Harry, finally making him look up to the Professor. Snape then walks to where he can speak to Harry more properly.] Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? [Hermione raises her hand. Harry shrugs.] You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? [Hermione's hand raises again.]
Harry: I don't know, sir.
Snape: And what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane?
Harry: I don't know, sir.
Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything... [Draco has a smirk on his face] is it, Mr. Potter?
(Extended Version)

Harry: Clearly, Hermione knows. Since it's a pity not to ask her.
[Hermione looks a bit surprised as everyone laughs]

Snape: Silence. [he turns to Harry, looking a bit insulted; Harry seemingly gulps. Snape then walks over to his desk. To Hermione, who has still got her hand up.] And put her hand down, you silly girl. [He sits in front of Harry, and leans towards him.] For your information, Potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. [everything is quiet] Well? [to the students] Why aren't you all copying this down? [The students obey Snape and start to write down what Snape said. Snape returns to his desk, and dips his quill into some ink.] And Gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek. [Snape then starts writing; Hermione looks at Harry and then starts writing. Harry looks at Snape, who turns slightly and then continues writing]
(Normal Version)

[Harry stares at Snape, knowing that he shows dislike for the boy. In the great hall, around midday. The students are all doing their homework. Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.]

Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. [Looks in cup and shakes head.] Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before-
[Ron was cut off when a mighty flash occurs. We now see that the cup has exploded and Seamus is left charred. Several students laugh at this as Hermione fans away the smoke with her hand. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.]

Ron: Ah. Mail's here!
[The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.]

Harry: Can I borrow this? [Ron nods] Thanks.
[Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear glass ball with a gold banner around it.]

Seamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!
Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red, [the smoke turns red] it means you've forgotten something.
Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts, listen. [he reads the article] Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.
New Seeker
[That afternoon, outside the castle, the students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, Madam Hooch, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.]

Hooch: Good afternoon, class.
Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. [to the class] Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, up!
Class: Up!
[After Harry said "Up”!, the broom immediately flies into his hand.]

Harry: [amazed] Wow.
[Hermione stares at him as the class continues.]

Draco: Up! [broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.]
Hooch: With feeling!
Hermione: [as her broomstick slowly rises] Up. Up. Up. Up.
Ron: Up!! [His broom immediately shot up and whacked him on the nose] Ooh! [Harry laughs] Shut up, Harry. [Ron then seemingly starts to laugh after he recovered]
Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. [the class mounts on their broomsticks] When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...
[She blows the whistle. However, Neville's broomstick somehow lifts him off the ground. Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.]

Neville: Oh...
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.
Girl: Neville, what are you doing?
Students: Neville...Neville...
Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.
Hooch: [Neville begins soaring away uncontrollably] M-M-Mr. Longbottom! Mr. Longbottom!
Neville: AHH!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!
Neville: Down! Down! Ahhhh!
Harry: Neville!
Neville: Help!!!
[he immediately skyrockets towards the sky]

Hooch: Come back down this instant!
Neville: AHH!
[He flies uncontrollably in the air and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch quickly holds out her wand to stop him.]

Neville: Help!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom-! [However, the students quickly stand back as Hooch dives out of the way, allowing Neville to fly right through. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.]
Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! [zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.] Oh. Ah...help! [He wavers, then the cloak rips through the spear, and he falls. But his cloak catches on a torch, making Neville slip off from his cloak a second later and fell to the ground.] Ahh!
Hooch: Everyone out of the way! [She runs through the group, and they scatter.] Come on, get up.
Girl: Is he alright?
[Hooch is helping Neville up; he has broken his wrist after he fell.]

Neville: Owowowow.
Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. [Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen from him. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.] Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. [she leaves to the hospital wing.]
Draco: [snickers] Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse. [He and his goons laugh; Harry approaches him.]
Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.
Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. [he hops on his broom and soars around group, then through.] How 'bout up on the roof? [soars off and hovers several feet above the grounds.] What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?
[Finally having enough, Harry gets on his broom, Hermione stops him.]

Hermione: Harry, no way! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. [Harry flies off to face Draco, ignoring her.] What an idiot.
[Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.]

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!
Draco: Is that so? [Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.] Have it your way, then!
[Draco hurls the Remembrall into the air, like a baseball. Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working, he catches it. McGonagall notices this and looks surprised as Harry begins to fly back down to the grounds. The students all cheer as Harry lands back on the ground at ease. They run to see him.]

Boy: Good job, Harry!
Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.
[McGonagall appears in the grounds.]

McGonagall: Harry Potter? [Harry notices her] Follow me. [Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons snicker in delight.]
[McGonagall and Harry arrive outside of Professor Quirrell's classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.]

Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is...
McGonagall: You wait here.
Quirrell:... an essential in-gredient.
McGonagall: Professor Quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. Could I borrow Wood for a moment, please?
Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. [A boy called Oliver Wood, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.] And the vampire b-bat... [as Wood exits the classroom, an eerie roar is heard.]
McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!
[Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.]

Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew he'd do well.
Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.
[Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.]

Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!
Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.
George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... [They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.]
George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!
Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!
[Hermione, knowing what Harry is talking about, jumps up from her work and comes to join them.]

Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
[Later, the three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.]

Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
Harry: I-I didn't know.
Three-Headed Sentinel
[The three are walking up a staircase in the Grand Staircase tower. A railing pulls in, Hermione looks, but continues walking.]

Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
Harry: Who doesn't?
[The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.]

Ron: Ahh!
[Hermione gasps]

Harry: What's happening?
Hermione: The staircases change, remember? [The staircase stops, leading to a corridor.]
Harry: [taps Ron] Let's go this way.
Ron: Before the staircase moves again.
[They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark and deserted corridor.]

Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
[Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, Filch's cat, Mrs. Norris, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.]

Harry: Let's go.
[Mrs. Norris meows]

Ron: It's Filch's cat!
Harry: Run!
[The trio run through the corridor, flames are lit up on the stone supports, one by one, as they run past. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door.]

Harry: Quick! Let’s hide though that door!
[Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.]

Harry: It's locked!
Ron: That's it, we're done for!
Hermione: Oh, move over! [pushes through and pulls out her wand, aiming it at the lock] Alohomora. [The door's lock lifts up magically and it opens.] Get in. [They bustle in.]
Ron: Alohomora?
Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
[Filch arrives at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.]

Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? [Mrs. Norris meows] Come on. [they leave the corridor.]
Hermione: Filch is gone.
Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.
Hermione: It was locked.
Harry: And for good reason. [Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.]
All: AHHHHHHH! [The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.]
[They return to the Gryffindor Common Room. They are breathless.]

Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! [they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.]
Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
Harry: Guarding something?
Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled! [turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dormitory.]
Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!
[Harry nods in agreement]

Facts and Feathers
[Outside in the courtyard, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.]

Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. [picks up a red one] This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. [Points to the hoops in the Quidditch pitch in the distance.] The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. [throws ball to Harry.] With me so far?
Harry: [throws back] I think so. What are those? [points to two squirming chained down balls.]
Oliver: You better take this. [hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.] Careful now, it's comin' back. [The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue, surprisingly without damaging it.] Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh. [The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.]
Harry: What is that?
Oliver: Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch. [hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.]
Harry: I like this ball.
Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
Harry: What do I do with it?
Oliver: You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.
[The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.]

Harry: Whoa.
[In Professor Flitwick's class. Filtwick is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books to make up for his stature and to see his class.]

Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? [Hermione raises hers.] Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone.
All (including Flitwick): The swish and flick.
Flitwick: Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
[The class begin to enunciate and doing the movements on their feathers]

Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.
Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar! [he waves his wand really fast numerous times. Hermione stops him.]
Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not Leviosar.
Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
[Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.]

Hermione: Wingardium Leviosa. [The feather glows and lifts up.]
Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!
[Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly. Seamus begins swishing at his feather.]

Seamus: Wingard Levosa.
Flitwick: Well done, dear.
[An almighty explosion flashes. Flitwick gasps, as Ron and Hermione turn to the source of the explosion]

Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.
[We see that Seamus is charred again with his feather, now smoldering to ashes.]

Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
[Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.]

Ron: [mimicking Hermione] It's Levioooosa, not Leviosaaaar. [normal voice] She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
[Hermione rushes past Ron, hugging her books and sniffling in tears.]

Harry: I think she heard you.
[Hermione disappears into the crowd, deeply hurt by Ron's words.]

Mountain Troll
[That Halloween night, the great hall has floating Jack O'Lanterns in place of the candles. Harry notices an empty spot on the bench.]

Harry: Where's Hermione?
Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
[Harry glances at Ron with a disapproving look on his face; Ron shrugs. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes running into the Great Hall in panic.]

Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! [Dumbledore rises from his seat in concern. Everyone look at Quirrell and he stops and there is utter silence.] Thought you ought to know.
[He passes out. The room is silent, and then everyone freaks out, screaming and running.]

Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! [Everyone stops and calms down.] Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!
Boy: Stay together!
[Snape looks aghast, and he walks out through a doorway. A bit later, Percy is leading the house down a corridor.]

Percy: Gryffindors, keep up please. And stay alert!
Harry: How could a troll get in?
Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. [Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.] What?
Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!
[The two separate themselves from the crowd. They run down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise and a large shadow on the wall.]

Ron: I think the troll's left the dungeon!
[Harry pulls Ron into a doorway, they peer out to see a large, ugly troll thunks by into a room.]

Harry: It’s going into the Girl's Bathroom!
[In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.]

Harry: Hermione, move!
[The troll smashes the remaining stalls.]

Hermione: Help! Help! [The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.]
Ron: Hey, pea brain! [Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.]
Hermione: Ahhh! Help!
[Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.]

Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! [He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand shoots up the troll's nose.]
Ron: Ew.
[Ron and Hermione were disgusted by Harry’s sand in the troll’s nose. The troll snorts, and whips around.]

Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!
[The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down.]

Harry: Do something!
[It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.]

Ron: What? [the troll swipes at Harry repeatedly]
Harry: Anything! Hurry up!
[Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.]

Hermione: Swish and flick!
Ron: [correctly punctuating the words] Wingardium Leviosa! [Flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down.] Cool. [It hits the troll's head that hard and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and slowly comes crashing down, knocking him out. Hermione approaches carefully.]
Hermione: Is it...dead?
Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. [He grabs his wand...which is covered in mucus.] Ew. Troll bogies.
[Harry wipes his wand on his robes. Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in. They all gasp at the knocked out troll.]

McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...
Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. [The teachers, Ron and Harry look at her.]
McGonagall: Miss Granger?
Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
McGonagall: Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. [Harry notices Snape's leg, which has the trousers' leg torn and a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.] I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. [she turns to Harry and Ron] As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you. [Harry and Ron grin at each other] For sheer dumb luck.
[Snape and McGonagall leave the bathroom]

Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. [Harry, Ron and Hermione exit the bathroom. Quirrell looks at the unconscious troll. The troll growls, seemingly going to wake up.] Ahh! Hehe....
(Extended Scene)

[Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking back to the Gryffindor Common Room through the corridor.]

Harry: [to Hermione] Good for you to get us out of trouble like that.
Ron: Mind you, I mean, we did save her life.
Harry: Mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her.
[Hermione looks at Ron.]

Ron: What are friends for?
[They both smile at each other as they carry on through the corridor.]

Quidditch
[The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.]
Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.
Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.
Harry: I'm not hungry.
[Snape appears at the table.]

Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. [Snape walks off, limping. Harry notices this.]
Harry: That explains the blood.
Hermione: Blood?
Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?
Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
Hermione: So you're saying...
Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
[Hedwig screeches as she enters the Great Hall. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off at the table.]
Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?
Harry: But I-I never get mail.
Ron: Let's open it.
[They open it to reveal a broomstick.]

Harry: It's a broomstick!
Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. [recognizing the model] It's a Nimbus 2000!
Harry: But who...?
[He notices Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.] [Later on, inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.]

Oliver: Scared, Harry?
Harry: A little.
Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.
[Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. Lee Jordan, the Quidditch commentator is announcing from a tower.]

Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
[Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering.]

Neville: Gryffindor!
[The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.]

Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. [looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.]
Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
[The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.]

Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
[Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, Angelia Johnson, zooms past the Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.]

Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! [He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindor’s name.]
[Harry, in the air, claps.]

Harry: Yes! [a bludger suddenly zooms by him.] Whoa!
[In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.]

Hagrid: Well done!
Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
[Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and Katie Bell pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!]

Ron and Seamus: Yay!
Harry: Yes!
Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! [he adds another 10 to the score with a ding.]
Gryffindors: Yay!
[The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.]

Flint: Give me that! [he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver directly in the stomach and he plummets to the ground, knocked out.]
[This causes the entire audience to boo; Harry is visibly upset as the Slytherins laugh. The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Lee adds 10 points in the plaque with Slytherin's name. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.]

Flint: [to his teammates] Take that side!
[They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again.

Interference Overcome
[Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then suddenly his broom starts bucking and turning.]
Harry: Whoa! Whooa!
Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
[Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is visibly muttering.]

Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!
Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Hermione: Leave it to me. [She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves the stands.]
[Harry is knocked and thrown around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.]

Ron: [concerned] Come on, Hermione!
[Hermione is hurrying up in the tower structures. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.]

Hermione: [quietly] Lacarnum Inflamarae.
[A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione quickly leaves.]

Man: Fire! You're on fire!
Snape: What? Oh! [knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.]
Ron: Go!
Hagrid: Go go go!
[Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches. The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.]

Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!
[Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.]

Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Hooch: [Blows her whistle whilst riding on her broomstick] Gryffindor win!
[The crowd cheers in joy including Gryffindor]

Draco: [dismayed] No!
Hagrid: Yes!
Hermione: Whoo-hoo!
[McGonagall giggles happily. Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.]

Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!
Christmas Gift
[Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.]

Hagrid: Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry’s broom?
Harry: Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Hagrid: [turns to them, suspiciously] Who told you ‘bout Fluffy?
Ron: Fluffy?
Hermione: That thing has a name?
Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the..
Harry: Yes?
Hagrid: Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
Harry: But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.
Harry: Exactly.
Hagrid: [Sighs] Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
Harry: [Curious and turns to Ron then back to Hagrid] Nicholas Flamel?
Hagrid: [Mumbles to himself] I shouldn't said that. I should not have said that.
[He then leaves, mumbling to himself "I should have not said that"]

Harry: Nicholas Flamel. [Turns to Hermione] Who's Nicholas Flamel?
Hermione: I don't know. [Shakes her head]
[It is now Christmas at Hogwarts, with snow falling. Hagrid is dragging a massive Christmas tree to the castle.] [Hermione walks to the Great Hall entrance with her luggage and wearing a scarf as the ghosts are singing Christmas songs.]

Ghosts: Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ring the Hogwart bell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas...
[Hermione looks from the massive Christmas tree as Flitwick uses his wand to put another ornament on the tree to Harry and Ron as they play Chess and walks towards them.]
Harry: Knight to E5. [The Knight moves to its destination. Hermione walks up behind Harry.]
Ron: [With a smug face] Queen to E5.
[Hermione watches as Ron's queen goes over to Harry's knight and whacks the knight with her chair. Ron grins.]

Hermione: [With a shocked face] That's totally barbaric!
Ron: That's wizard's chess. [Looks over to Hermione] I see you've packed.
Hermione: See you haven't.
Ron: Change of plans, my parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
Hermione: Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
Ron: We've looked a hundred times.
Hermione: [Leans over on the table closer to Ron and Harry] Not in the restricted section. Happy Christmas. [Hermione leaves Ron and Harry]
Ron: [Looks at Harry] I think we've had a bad influence on her.
[It is now Christmas morning. Ron is waking Harry up]

Ron: [From downstairs] Harry wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!
[Harry puts on his glasses and runs out of bed. He then looks down at Ron]
Ron: [Looking up at Harry] Happy Christmas, Harry.
Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. [Harry notices Ron's sweater] What are you wearing?
Ron: [Looks down at sweater] Oh. My mum made it. [Looking back up at Harry] It looks like you've got one too.
Harry: I-I've got presents?
Ron: [Nodding] Yeah!
[Harry runs down the staircase to see his presents]

Ron: There they are.
[Harry sees a note on the present and opens it, reading it out]

Harry: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. [Harry looks over to Ron, who shrugs his shoulders]
[Harry then proceeds to open the remaining of his present. He pulls out a blanket-like object]

Ron: What is it?
Harry: [Looking down at the object] It's some kind of cloak.
Ron: Well, let's see then, put it on.
[Harry then wraps the cloak around his shoulders, making his body invisible]

Ron: Whoa!
Harry: [Looks down at his invisible body] My body's gone!
Ron: I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.
Harry: I'm invisible? [Harry spins around, looking down at himself]
Ron: They're really rare. [Ron looks down at the note] I wonder who gave it to you?
Harry: [Now also looking down at the note] There was no name. It just said use it well.
Cloaked in darkness
[Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed, revealing to be Harry who searches the bookshelves.]

Harry: Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
[Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears from between the pages, which screams madly and loudly. Harry immediately slams the book shuts and puts it back.]

Filch: Who's there?! [Harry whips around, and quickly grabs his cloak, causing the lamp to fall and shatter.] I know you're in there. You can't hide. [Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.] Who is it? Show yourself!
[Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He exits into the hall, where Mrs. Norris, who meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.]

Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...
Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?
Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. [Snape senses something who causes Harry to stop breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.] We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
[Filch arrives, carrying the broken lantern.]

Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.
[Upon hearing this, Snape and Quirrell dart off]

The Mirror of Erised
[A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center, known as the Mirror of Erised. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In the reflection, he sees two people appear who are Harry's late parents, James and Lily Potter.]

Harry: Mum? [Lily nods and smiles] Dad? [James nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.]
[Back in the boy's dormitory in Gryffindor tower, Harry comes whipping in, invisible.]

Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! [pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.] Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!
Ron: [tired] Why?
Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!
[Back in the room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.]

Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
Ron: I only see me.
Harry: [moves over] Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad
Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. [Harry smiles sadly.]
(Extended Version)

[One day, in the Great Hall where most of the students, particularly the Weasleys are eating, Harry sits in front of the fireplace.]

George: Do you like yours, Ron? [Ron turns to harry who still sits in front of the fireplace who is very quiet.] Ron?
Ron: I'll be right back. [He leaves the table and comes up to Harry.] Want to play chess?
Harry: No.
Ron: We go and visit Hagrid?
Harry: No.
Ron: Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't. There's something not quite right about that mirror.
[Harry nods and Ron leaves to go back to the table as Harry continues to stare at the fireplace.]

(Original Version)

[The next night, Harry is back in the room where the mirror is, gazing longingly at the reflection where his parents are in. Dumbledore appears far behind him]

Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? [Harry turns around and stands up.] I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?
Dumbledore: [whilst looking at the mirror] Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. [Harry looks back at the mirror, knowing that Dumbledore is right.]
Norbert
[It is snowy in daytime, Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. As the time passed when she returns, it is now spring time.]

(Extended Version)

Harry: Hi, Hedwig. [Hedwig has just flown down to the table where Harry, Ron and Hermoine are studying]
Hermione: Look at you playing with your cards. Pathetic! We've got final exams coming up soon.
Ron: I'm ready! Ask me any question.
Hermione: All right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
Ron: ...I forgot.
Hermione: And what, may I ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam?
Ron: Copy off you?
Hermione: No, you won't! Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.
Ron: That's insulting! It's as if they don't trust us! [checks a card, irritated] Dumbledore again!
[Just then, Neville Longbottom comes hopping into the Great Hall with his legs stuck together as the other students laugh at him.]

Ron: Leg-Locker Curse?
Harry: Malfoy. [Neville approaches them amidst laughter from the other students]
Ron: You have got to start standing up to people, Neville.
Neville: [wobbling uncontrollably] How? I can barely stand at all!
Seamus: [jumping up, wand at the ready] I'll do the counter-curse!
Neville Longbottom: No, that's all I need... you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire!
Seamus: [slamming his wand down angrily] I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back! [He then stalks off angrily, showing a large chunk of hair missing from the back of his head.]
Harry: I found him! [hands Ron a Chocolate Frog card of Dumbledore]
Ron: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark" Wizard Grindelwald in 1945–'
Harry: Go on.
Ron: '-for his discovery of the 12 uses of Dragon Blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas Flamel!'
Harry: I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
Hermione: [beaming excitedly] Follow me!
[the Trio tears out of the Great Hall, leaving poor Neville still flailing around]
Neville Longbottom: Hey, wait, where are you going? What about the counter-curse?! [before he can say another word he topples over backwards, the other students start laughing.]
(Original Version)

[In the library, Harry and Ron are seated, reading until Hermione comes up with a huge book and thumps it onto the table making Harry jump.]

Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Ron: This is light?
Hermione: Of course! Here it is! [as she reads the description in the page] "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
Ron and Harry: The what?
Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
Ron: Immortal?
Hermione: It means you'll never die.
Ron: I know what it means!
Harry: Shh!
Hermione: "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!
[They all look at each other in concern. It is nighttime in the castle grounds, Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across to Hagrid's hut. They knock on the door and Hagrid, who is wearing an apron and oven mitts, opens it from the inside.]

Harry: Hagrid!
Hagrid: Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.
[He begins to close the door]

All three: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
[Hagrid opens the door again]

Hagrid: Oh.
[They all come into Hagrid's hut.]

Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.
Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.
Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
Harry: What?
Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
Harry: Wait a minute. [Ron soon sees Hagrid's boar-hound Fang, who sniffs him.] One of the teachers?
Hermione: [whilst sitting in a large chair] Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me. [Hermione looks at Ron, who is still being sniffed in the face by Fang. Finally Ron shuffles away.] Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. [A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.] Oh! [Hagrid hurries over and grabs something] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [He places it on the table. It was an egg. The group crowds around.]
Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?
Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...
Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?
Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.
[The egg rattles and cracks open as pieces fly off; a small baby dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.]

Hermione: Is that...a dragon?
Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.
[Norbert squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.]

Harry: Norbert?
Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he? [Ron laughs] Don't you, Norbert? [he raises fingers back and forth across Norbert's chin] Dededede.
[Norbert backs away, until he hiccups and blast a small fireball into Hagrid's beard.]

Hagrid: Ohh! [he quickly pats out the smolders in his beard] Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. [Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.] Who's that? [It turns out to be Draco Malfoy, who scampers away.]
Harry: Malfoy.
Hagrid: Oh, dear.
[Harry, Ron and Hermione are walking back through a corridor as an owl screeches.]

Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?
Ron: It's bad.
[They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears, sternly.]

McGonagall: Good evening.
[Then, Malfoy appears smugly beside her. Inside McGonagall's classroom, the three are now standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.]

McGonagall: [sternly] Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
Harry: 50?!
McGonagall: Each. [Harry gasps] And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
[Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes with great concern.]

Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."
McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.
[Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, as Draco sags, knowing that the tables have turned.]

The Forbidden Forest
[The next night, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.]

Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. [Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.] You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. [Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.] A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
Hagrid: [sniffs and sighs] Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.
Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...[a howl sounds]...werewolves!
Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. [Draco looks frightened.] Nighty-night. [He leaves to go back into the castle]
Hagrid: Right. Let's go.
[In the Forbidden Forest, the group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.]

Harry: Hagrid, what's that?
Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. [Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.] So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.
Ron: Okay.
Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. [Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.]
Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!
Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. [Fang whines.]
[Harry and Draco are walking through a part of the forest, with Fang leading. Draco has the lamp in his hand.]

Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
Draco: Scared, Potter?! [He scoffs, but suddenly hears a howl] Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.
[Harry and Draco approach a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.]

Harry: What is it, Fang?
[Up ahead is a cloaked figure who is crouching over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood from its wound. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth. Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting. Draco screams with pure fear and runs away with Fang.]

Draco: HELP!!!!!
[Harry is left by himself at the mercy of the figure who slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoof-beats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur called Firenze. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.]

Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
Harry: But what was that thing you saved me from?
Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
Harry: But who would choose such a life?
Firenze: Can you think of no one?
Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry: [realizing] The Philosopher's Stone.
[Fang suddenly barks and Harry looks up to see Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear. Hagrid has his crossbow ready, but lowers it when he sees Firenze.]

Hermione: Harry!
Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? [Harry nods]
Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.
[He leaves as the group look at the dead unicorn.]

Up to Something
Hermione: [she, Harry, and Ron are meeting in the common room] You mean You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.
Ron: But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?
Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.
Ron: [gulps] And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
Hermione: Hang on a minute. [Harry and Ron both glance at her] We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. [gives him a reassuring smile; he nods]
Through the Trapdoor
Wizard's Chess
Sacrifice Play
Man With Two Faces
[Harry walks down the stairs slowly. Halfway down, he winces, feeling his scar burning, and sees Professor Quirrell standing before the Mirror of Erised.]

Harry: You? [Quirrell turns to face him] No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-
Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
Harry: But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.
Quirrell: [smiling evilly] No, dear boy. I tried to kill you. [Harry eyes him in disbelief and confusion] And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.
Harry: Snape was trying to save me?
Quirrell: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
Harry: Then-then you let the troll in.
Quirrell: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. [he turns towards the mirror again; Harry winces as his scar burns again] He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never. [staring into the mirror] Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
Unseen Inhuman Voice: Use the boy. [Harry looks around, wondering where the voice is coming from]
Quirrell: [turns to Harry] Come here, Potter. Now! [Harry slowly walks down the stairs, towards Quirrell and the mirror] Tell me... what do you see? [Harry looks into the mirror, and for a few seconds, sees him standing next to Quirrell, then his reflection reaches into its pocket and pulls out a gleaming red ruby, the Philosopher’s Stone; Harry stares in amazement as his reflection smiles and winks, then puts the stone back in its pocket; Harry feels his pocket and realizes the Stone really is in his pocket, then looks up again] What is it? [glances at Harry while speaking] What do you see?
Harry: [looks at Quirrell, then back at the mirror, determined not to let Quirrell know that he has the Stone] I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.
Unseen Inhuman Voice: He lies.
Quirrell: [angrily shouting] Tell the truth! What do you see?!
Unseen Inhuman Voice: Let me speak to him.
Quirrell: [as Harry backs away] Master, you are not strong enough.
Unseen Inhuman Voice: I have strength enough for this.
[Quirrell reaches up and starts unwrapping his turban as he turns so his back is to the mirror. Harry turns toward the staircase into the room, wondering whether he should try to escape, then turns towards Quirrell again. He is almost finished unwrapping his turban, save for a piece covering the back of his head. Finally, he removes the turban, revealing a scary-looking chalk white face, Voldemort. He cranes around and opens his eyes.]

Voldemort: Harry Potter, we meet again.
Harry: [realizing his identity] Voldemort.
Voldemort: Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. [realizing Voldemort is referring to the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry turns and runs back up the stairs]
Magic Touch
Voldemort: Stop him. [Quirrell snaps his fingers, instantly causing fire walls to block all the exits, trapping Harry in the room] Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
Harry: [shakes his head] Never!
Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. [In the mirror, Harry's parents appear in the reflection.] All I ask for is something in return. [Harry takes the Stone from his pocket.] That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! [James and Lily Potter fade from the reflection]
Harry: You liar!
Voldemort: Kill him!
[Under orders, Quirrell soars into the air and grabs hold of Harry with one hand on his throat. They fall to the steps, causing the Stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's hand in an attempt to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand as Quirrell winces.]

Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! [He backs up away from Harry. His hand is crumbling into ash and dust.] What is this magic? [His hand disintegrates]
Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!
[Quirrell walks forward towards Harry, who then touches his face with his hands, causing Quirrell to scream in pain, and especially Voldemort to wince. Harry looks on horrified as Quirrell backs up with his face horrendously burned. Quirrell crumbles as he walks forward, turning his body completely in ash and dust, and falls to the floor, leaving only his clothing. Harry gasps, as he looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs. However, from behind, dust clouds form from Quirrell's corpse, causing Harry to turn around as the dust clouds with Voldemort's face rushes forward screaming and goes through Harry who also screams. Voldemort flies away, as Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the Stone in an outstretched hand.]

Mark of Love
[In the hospital wing the next day, Harry is lying in bed with his arm bandaged. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.]

Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
Harry: Admirers?
Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. [They both smile.] Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.
Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?
Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
Dumbledore: [sits on the bed.] He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.
Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? [Harry shakes his head.] It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. [Harry touches his scar.] No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.
Harry: What is it?
Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. [Pats Harry's head gently and stands up.] Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...[takes brown bean and eats it.] Mm. Alas. Earwax.
[Harry with his arm still bandaged enters a corridor where up on a stairwell balcony, Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.]

Harry: All right there, Ron?
Ron: All right? You?
Harry: [as he shrugs] All right. Hermione?
Hermione: [smiling] Never better.
House Cup Winner
[We see the Great Hall, full of students eating and talking with each other. There are green and silver banners with the Slytherin symbol above their heads, already indicating the house with the most points. Dumbledore gives a slight nod to professor McGonagall, who then clinks her spoon to her glass, to ask attention from the students. The crowd falls silent. Dumbledore stands up and speaks with his magically magnified voice.]

Dumbledore: Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points! [There is a medium applause from the crowd.] In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points! [The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.] Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points! [Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.] And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house! [A loud roar rises from the Slytherin table, as students stand up and clap for their selves. Malfoy gives a mean look to the Gryffindor table, where Harry, Ron and Hermione look slightly depressed.] Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award. [Some faces at the Gryffindor table rise hopefully.] First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points! [Hermione looks surprised, while the other Gryffindor students applaud her. Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle don't like what's happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.] Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points! [Ron looks even more surprised than Hermione did and the Gryffindor table is applauding even louder.] And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!
[The Gryffindors cheer again, this time even louder than before. Malfoy has a cringing look on his face, while Harry sees a proud, smiling professor McGonagall at the teacher's table. Hermione, who has done some quick math, whispers to her fellow students.]

Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!
[Now, the Gryffindors look really hopeful, as Dumbledore hasn't finished talking yet.]

Dumbledore: And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom! [Neville can't believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione's whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.] Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order! [He motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol] Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
[The Great Hall exploded with roars and applause, not only from the Gryffindors, but also from the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs, because they are glad that, for the first time in seven years, someone else than Slytherin has won the House Cup. Hagrid can't help himself to also cheer, and all students except the Slytherins throw their hats in the air, while Malfoy angrily throws his on the table in defeat. The Gryffindors around Harry are all congratulating him and Harry smiles to Hagrid, who smiles back.]

In a Cage
[In the clouds during sunset, we see the Warner Bros. Pictures shield moving towards the screen and rotates out of the shot. Then, the film's title in golden letters slowly zooms through the camera afterwards; it is a quiet summer evening in Surrey. Harry Potter is in his bedroom looking at the picture book that Rubeus Hagrid gave him at the end of his first year at Hogwarts; he looks at the picture of him as a baby with his parents, then turns the page to look at a picture of him with his closest friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger; he then hears his owl Hedwig chirping and hooting in her cage.]
Harry: I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. [Hedwig nibbles at her lock, squawking loudly] Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
Vernon: [angrily from downstairs] Harry Potter!
Harry: [glances downstairs then looks at Hedwig before closing his book and going downstairs] Now you've done it.
[In the kitchen, Petunia is working on a cake as Harry enters.]

Petunia: He's in there, Vernon.
[Harry enters the living room, where Uncle Vernon is getting Dudley dressed up.]

Vernon: I'm warning you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
Harry: But she's bored. If I could only let her out for... an hour or two.
Vernon: [chuckles] So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
Harry: But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
Dudley: Who would want to be friends with you? [bumps Harry harshly]
Vernon: I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you a were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Petunia: [to Dudley] Not now, bumpkins. It's for when the Masons arrive.
Vernon: Which should be any minute. [motions for his family to come into the living room] Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?
Petunia: In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
Vernon: Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
Dudley: I'll be waiting to open the door.
Vernon: Excellent. [the three of them turn to Harry with scornful looks] And you...?
Harry: I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
Vernon: Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, and you will not mess it up.
Dobby's Warning
[Harry goes upstairs as the doorbell rings.]

Vernon: [from below] Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
[Harry hears someone laughing madly in his room. He opens the door to find, a house elf named Dobby bouncing on his bed.]

Dobby: Harry Potter! Such an honor it is! [Harry closes the door.]
Harry: Who are you?
Dobby: Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
Harry: Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
Dobby: Oh, oh, yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?
Harry: Why don’t you sit down?
Dobby: S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? [he soon begins to cry]
Harry: Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! [Dobby cries louder] I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
Dobby: [stops crying when he hears that word] Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
Harry: You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
Dobby: No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. [he then bangs his head on the dresser drawer repeatedly] Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
Harry: Stop, Dobby! Dobby, shh! Dobby, please stop!
[From downstairs in the living room, the Dursleys and the Masons are having some wine as they hear the banging from above.]

Vernon: Oh, don't mind that. It's just the... cat! [he chuckles lightly, as Mr. and Mrs Mason look on, being convinced and concerned at the same time.]
Dobby: [still banging his head on the drawer] Bad Dobby!
Harry: Dobby, stop! Please be quiet. Are you all right?
Dobby: Dobby had to punish himself, sir. [pushes a stool closer to Harry] Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
Harry: Your family?
Dobby: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. [gets up and sits on the stool] Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they knew Dobby was here... [shivers] But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. [Harry looks at him in surprise] There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
Harry: What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
Dobby: [trying to resist himself from saying something] Oh, he! Can’t say!
Harry: Okay, I understand. You can’t say.
Dobby: Don’t make me talk. L-- [Dobby gets on the desk, grabs the lamp and hits himself with it.] Bad Dobby!
Harry: Dobby? Dobby, put the lamp down. [he keeps hitting himself, in the living room, Vernon is still doing his conversation with the Masons.]
Vernon: So, when they arrive at the ninth hole-- [Dobby’s shout is heard, Vernon hears it upstairs while looking suspicious.]
Harry: [trying to grab the lamp from Dobby] Give me the lamp! [Dobby keeps straining until Harry hears Vernon coming upstairs] Dobby, stop! [he finally grabs it from Dobby, grabs his rags, hides him in the closet, and closes the door] Get in there and keep quiet!
Vernon: [opening the door, stomping into the room, and glaring at Harry] What the devil are you doing up here?!
Harry: I was just... [Dobby slowly opens the closet door; Harry pushes it closed]
Vernon: You've just ruined the punchline of my Japanese golfer joke.
Harry: Sorry. [closes the closet door again]
Vernon: [glances at the closet door, unaware of Dobby's presence, then lifts his finger as he turns his eyes back to Harry] One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never born, boy. [sees the closet door opening again] And fix that door.
Harry: [closing the door again] Yes, sir. [Vernon glares at Harry as he walks out of the room, pulling the door closed; with Vernon gone, Harry opens the closet door to let Dobby out] See why I've got to go back? [Dobby removes a sock from his ear] I don't belong here; I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. [Dobby sniffs the sock and throws it aside and turns to Harry] It's the only place I've got friends.
Car Rescue
[Petunia and Dudley watch as Vernon drills bars into Harry's bedroom window.]

Vernon: [after tightening the bars, he glares at Harry, who glares back at him through the window] You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
[Later that evening, as Harry is asleep in bed, he hears what sounds like a car engine outside. Waking up and putting on his glasses, he gets out of bed and walks to the window. Looking out the window, he sees a strange object moving through the sky. As he looks, the object appears to be a shooting star, before turning into two beams of light. A turquoise Ford Anglia car flies to Harry's bedroom window, then turns to the right as Harry and Hedwig silently watch. In the Ford Anglia is Ron, accompanied by his older twins, Fred and George.]

Ron: [looking at Harry through the bars on his window] Hiya, Harry.
Harry: [surprised to see his friends] Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?
Ron: Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!
The Burrow
Fred: [walking to the window and opening it to unlock the door] Come on. Okay, come on. Shhh! Shhh! [checking that the coast is clear then beckoning the others inside] Okay, come on.
To Diagon Alley
[Mrs. Weasley picks up a pot of the mantel.]
Flourish and Blotts
[A copy of Gilderoy Lockhart's autobiography "Magical Me" is on display as Harry and Hermione enter the store.]
Flying to Hogwarts
[The Ford Anglia is parked at King's Cross Station as numerous people walk past it. In the station, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Percy, Fred, George, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are desperate to catch the Hogwarts Express before it leaves.]

Mr. Weasley: 10:58. Come on, come on!
Mrs. Weasley: Train will be leaving any moment!
Mr. Weasley: Fred, George, Percy, you first! [Fred pushes his cart through the barrier to Platform 9¾, followed by Percy and George]
Mrs. Weasley: [patting Ginny on the back] Okay. [Ginny pushes her cart and runs through the wall; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley follow]
Mr. Weasley: After you, dear. [Mrs. Weasley disappears through the wall; Mr. Weasley goes in immediately after her]
Mrs. Weasley: [meeting up with Ginny as she stands by the Hogwarts Express, which is just about ready to go] Come on, Ginny. We'll get you a seat. Hurry! [the three run for the train; outside, only Harry and Ron are left]
Harry: [turning to Ron] Let's go.
[Ron nods; then the two boys push their carts directly for the wall. However, instead of going through the wall, Harry inexplicably crashes into it and falls over; Ron loses control of his cart, and falls over as well. A station agent, the same man Harry saw a year ago, notices while speaking to a woman, and approaches Harry and Ron as they get to their feet, groaning from their slight injuries.]

Station Agent: Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
Harry: Sorry. Lo-lost control of the trolley. [the agent shakes his head at them and walks away; Harry glances at Ron] Why can't we get through?
Ron: I don't know. [touching the wall with his hand, discovering the bricks have become solid] The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. [Harry touches the wall to see that it's completely solid]
Harry: [hearing a clock chime, he and Ron look up at a nearby clock displaying the time 11:00] The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it!
Ron: [glancing at the clock in horror, then turning to Harry] Harry... if we can't get through, maybe mom and dad can't get back.
Harry: [trying to decide what to do about their dilemma] Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
Ron: [the sound of these words suddenly gives him an idea] The car... [Harry glances at him, wondering what he's got in mind]
Whomping Willow
[As the Ford Anglia flies alongside the Hogwarts Express, it puts on its headlights and flies off. Soon enough, Harry and Ron are flying over the lake, and have arrived at Hogwarts.]

Ron: [glancing at the castle with a smile as he turns to face Harry] Welcome home. [Harry smiles, happy to be back at Hogwarts after such an unpleasant summer]
Not Expelled... Today
[Harry and Ron walk into the Entrance Hall with their belongings and pets, which they leave with the rest of the students' luggage.]

Harry: See you, Hedwig! [he and Ron then run up the steps] So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform 9¾, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. [reaching the top of the stairs, they come face-to-face with the caretaker, Argus Filch and his pet cat, Mrs. Norris]
Filch: [glaring at them with a malicious smile] Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. [Harry and Ron glance at each other nervously] Oh, dear, we are in trouble. [he smiles more devilishly; moments later, Harry and Ron are standing in Severus Snape's classroom]
Snape: [holding up a newspaper article about their flying car at King's Cross Station] You were seen by no less than seven Muggles! [furiously throws the newspaper aside and glares at them] Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born!
Ron: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
Snape: Silence! [walking around his desk towards them] I assure you... that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight! As it is.
Dumbledore: They are not. [Harry, Ron, Snape, and Filch turn towards the doorway to see Dumbledore standing there, accompanied by his associate, Professor McGonagall. Both of them are looking stern.]
Harry: [glancing at Dumbledore and McGonagall] Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall.
Snape: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
Dumbledore: I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
Ron: We'll go and get our stuff.
McGonagall: What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
Ron: Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
McGonagall: Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight. And you will both receive detention.
[Harry and Ron turn back to Snape who casts a glare of pure venom at them]

(Extended Version)

Dumbledore: And now I suggest that we all return to the feast. There is a delicious-looking custard tart that I am most anxious to sample.
[Dumbledore and McGonagall exit the office and Snape follows behind with a disapproving facial expression. Harry and Ron pass Filch. Harry notices a envelope on the ground and picks it up. It's addressed to Filch and is about the basics of magic.]

Harry: Eh, Mr. Filch, you dropped this.
[Filch eyes the envelope before he grabs it and stuffs it in his pocket fast while looking flabbergasted. Harry and Ron walk on.]


Mandrakes; Ron's Howler
[The next day, the second year students are in the Herbology greenhouses as Professor Sprout enters.]
Professor Sprout: Morning, everyone. [taps the stand to get everyone's attention] Good morning, everyone.
Students: Good morning, Professor Sprout.
Gilderoy Lockhart
[The students are seated in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, decorated with portraits of its owner: Gilderoy Lockhart; the door to the office opens and Lockhart walks out.]
Lockhart: Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: me, Gilderoy Lockhart.
Mudbloods and Murmurs
[Harry is walking down the corridor wearing his Quidditch outfit, accompanied by the rest of the team: Oliver Wood, Fred, George, Angelina Johnson, Alicia Spinnet, and Katie Bell.]
Oliver: I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are going to train earlier, harder, and longer. [glancing to his left, the rest of the team follows his gaze] What...? I don't believe it. [stepping out into the courtyard, they come across the Slytherin Quidditch team, also dressed for Quidditch, as Ron and Hermione are sitting nearby; Oliver directs his attention to the team's captain, Marcus Flint] Where do you think you're going, Flint?
Marcus: Quidditch practice.
Oliver: I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
Marcus: Easy, Wood. I've got a note. [holds out a rolled up scroll; Wood takes it and opens it]
Ron: Uh-oh. I smell trouble. [he and Hermione get up and walk towards the two teams]
Oliver: [reading the parchment] I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker." [looks up from the parchment] You've got a new Seeker, who? [Marcus steps aside, and Draco steps out towards the Gryffindor team members]
Harry: [amazed that his nemesis is now a member of the Slytherin Quidditch team] Malfoy?
Draco: That's right. And that's not all that's new this year. [puts his broom at his side; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team examine the brooms Draco and the rest of the Slytherin team are holding]
Ron: Those are Nimbus 2001s. How did you get those?
Marcus: A gift from Draco's father.
Draco: You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
Hermione: At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
[Draco glares at her in annoyance as he takes a few steps and stops only at arms length in front of her]

Draco: No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
[Hermione glares at him with a mixture of hate and hurt as Draco sneers.]

Ron: You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! [he takes out his wand and aims it at Draco] Eat slugs!
[Unfortunately, Ron's spell backfires, blasting him off backwards and onto the ground. Harry and Hermione immediately rush to his side.]

Hermione: You okay, Ron? Say something!
[Ron opens his mouth as if to say something, but instead he spits out a slug.]

Colin Creevey: [starts taking pictures of Ron] Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
Harry: No, Colin! Get out of the way. [he and Hermione help Ron to his feet] Let's take him to Hagrid. [Ron regurgitates another slug] He'll know what to do.
[The three of them rush off to Hagrid's while the Slytherins laugh at them.]

Writing on the Wall
[Harry is walking into the corridor when he suddenly hears the ominous voice again]

Ominous Voice: Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you... Let me kill you. Kill... kill... kill!
Hermione: [she and Ron just appear out of nowhere] Harry...
Harry: Did you hear it?
Ron: [concerned and confused] Hear what?
Harry: That voice.
Hermione: [getting concerned as well] Voice? What voice?
Harry: I heard it first in Lockhart's office, and then, again, just-- [he hears the voice once more]
Ominous Voice: It's time.
Harry: [getting tense] It's moving. I think it's going to kill.
Ron: [as Harry runs past them down the corridor] "Kill"?
Hermione: [she and Ron run after him] Harry, wait! Not so fast!
[Harry stops in the middle of the corridor, then looks down to see the floor is wet before walking to the right. Ron and Hermione run to catch up with him; they stop abruptly as they see numerous spiders scurrying away through a crack in the window.]

Harry: Strange... I've never seen spiders act like that.
Ron: I don't like spiders. [they then glance at something else on the floor] What's that?
Hermione: [they gaze at a puddle of water, where they can see what appears to be bloody writing, then look up at the wall to see foreboding words written in blood which Hermione reads] "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware." It's written in blood.
Harry: [looks to the left] Oh, no. [Hermione follows Harry's gaze and gasps when she sees what he is seeing; he walks toward a torch on the wall, tied to the torch is Mrs. Norris, frozen and seemingly scared by something] It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris. [behind them, Percy walks into the corridor, leading the other Gryffindor house students]
[Soon enough, the corridor fills with students, who gaze at the bloody writing and Mrs. Norris, Madame Pomfrey expresses horror and shock; Colin gets his camera ready, but Percy stops him.]

Draco: "Enemies of the Heir, beware." [glances at the Gryffindor house students] You'll be next, Mudbloods. [Ron scowls and glares at him]
Filch: What's going on here? [pushing his way through the crowd] Go on, make way, make way. [glares at Harry] Potter... what are you...? [gazes past Harry at the frozen form of his cat and trembles] Mrs. Norris? [glares at Harry again] You murdered my cat.
Harry: No. No.
Filch: [as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle grin] I'll kill you. [smiles wickedly at Harry then grabs him by the shirt] I'll kill you!
Dumbledore: Argus? [Filch lets go of Harry; the students step aside as Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape arrive on the scene] Argus, I... [he glances at the writing on the wall] Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. [the students turn to leave; Harry, Ron, and Hermione follow] Everyone except [Harry, Ron, and Hermione stop] you three. [they turn to face him]
Ravenclaw Prefect: Ravenclaws, follow me.
Dumbledore: She's not dead, Argus. [Filch trembles, presumably from relief and confusion] She has been petrified.
Lockhart: Ah. Thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
Dumbledore: [smiles and nods] But how she has been petrified I cannot say.
Filch: [gesturing towards Harry] Ask him. It's him that done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
Harry: It's not true, sir. I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.
Filch: Rubbish.
Snape: If I might, headmaster. Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I for one don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
Lockhart: I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fanmail.
Hermione: That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We just found him when he said... [looks at Harry]
Snape: Yes, Ms. Granger?
Harry: When I said I wasn't hungry. [Snape turns towards him] We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris. [Snape turns towards Professor Dumbledore]
Dumbledore: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
Filch: [as Snape smiles slightly] My cat has been petrified. I want to see some punishment!
Dumbledore: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made, which will revive Mrs. Norris. [Filch trembles] And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution... to all.
[Harry, Ron, and Hermione nod. Moments later, they are walking along the Grand Staircase, as the numerous staircases change.]

Hermione: [as they ascend the stairs] It's a bit strange isn't it?
Harry: "Strange"?
Hermione: [turns to face him] You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up petrified. It's just... strange.
Harry: You think I should've told them, Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Ron: Are you mad?
Hermione: No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. [turns and walks along]
Man in Painting: She's right, you know. [Harry and Ron glance at him, then walk along]
About the Chamber
McGonagall: [at Transfiguration class the next day] Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. [Draco shrugs] Like so. [turns to a bird resting on a post to her right, tapping it with her wand as she speaks] One, two, three, Vera Verto. [a stream of magic emits from her wand, and the bird becomes a goblet; the other students express amazement] Now it's your turn? Who would like to go first? [approaches Ron] Ah! Mr. Weasley. One, two, three, Vera Verto.
Ron: Ahem! [silently taps his wand towards Scabbers three times] Vera Verto. [his wand causes Scabbers to turn into a furry goblet with his tail moving around while squeaking; Harry and some of the other students grin and laugh]
McGonagall: [as Ron picks up the Scabbers-goblet] That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. [Hermione raises her hand] Yes, Ms. Granger?
Hermione: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. [Draco gives Hermione a surprised look]
McGonagall: [glancing around the room and seeing that the students look somewhat interested] Very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.
Ron: [turns to Harry] Three guesses who.
McGonagall: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. [Hermione and Draco glare at each other] Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Well, shortly before departing, he sealed it, until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber, and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Hermione: Muggle-borns. [Professor McGonagall points her wand at her in an affirmative gesture]
McGonagall: Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such Chamber has been found. [turns and walks back to her desk]
Hermione: Professor, [Professor McGonagall turns around] what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
McGonagall: Well, the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster. [Hermione feels a sense of dread at these words; a horrified Ron turns around to look at Draco, who grins smugly at him]
Ron: [as he, Harry, and Hermione walk down the corridor] Do you think it's true? Do you really think there is a Chamber of Secrets?
Hermione: Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
Harry: [as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle walk down the corridor behind them] But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it really has been opened, then that means...
Hermione: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
Ron: [as Draco and Goyle walk past them, with Crabbe running to keep up] Let's think... [glances at their adversaries as they pass] who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
Hermione: If you're talking about Malfoy...
Ron: Of course! You heard him: "You'll be next, mudbloods."
Hermione: I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Harry: Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family, the whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Ron: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Hermione: Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult, not to mention, we'd be breaking fifty school rules, and it'll be dangerous, very dangerous.
Rogue bludger
[In the library, Hermione pulls a book titled "Most Potente Potions" off the shelf, then walks a few rows to where Harry and Ron are.]
Hermione: Here it is, the Polyjuice Potion. [reads from the book] "Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
Ron: You mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Hermione: Yes.
Ron: [he and Harry exchange grins] Wicked. Malfoy will tell us anything.
Hermione: [smiles slightly at their motivation] Exactly, but it's tricky. [glancing at the book again] I've never seen a more complicated potion.
Harry: Well, how long will it take to make?
Hermione: [looking up at Harry] A month.
Harry: A month?! But, Hermione... if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!
Hermione: I know, but it's the only plan we've got.
No longer safe
[Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid run to Harry as Lockhart runs to him followed by another group of students.]
Harry: [as his friends reach him] Thank you.
Hermione: Are you okay?
Harry: No. I think my... I think my arm's broken.
Lockhart: [kneeling down beside Harry] Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away.
Harry: No. Not you.
Dueling Club
[Harry lays in bed, shocked by what he just heard. A few days later, in the girls' bathroom, he tells Ron and Hermione what he overheard.]
Hermione: "Again"? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?

A Parselmouth
[Snape pulls Draco to his feet and pushes him forward.]
Lockhart: [as Draco raises his wand] I said disarm only!
Draco: Serpensortia! [swishes his wand and fires a cobra out of it; which then slithers along the playing field; Harry lowers his wand]
Snape: [walking past Draco towards the snake] Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you.
Lockhart: Allow me, Professor Snape. [Snape stops in his tracks] Alarte ascendare! [the snake jettisons high into the air, then falls back down, raises its head and turns toward Harry with a hiss]
Harry: Sya- hassa- she. (Leave them alone.) [the snake turns toward Justin Finch-Fletchey and hisses] Sya- hasi- heth. (Leave him alone.) [Snape watches suspiciously] Sya- hasi- heth. [the snake turns toward Harry again]
Nothing to tell
[Harry turns a corner and discovers Nearly Headless Nick, petrified with his head partially detached and floating in place. On the floor just a few feet away is Justin Finch-Fletchey, also petrified. Harry kneels down to examine his stiff body. As he does so, Filch walks out of a doorway behind him.]
Filch: Caught in the act. [Harry turns around at the sound of his voice] I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words. [grins wickedly and walks away]
Harry: No, Mr. Filch! Y-y-you don't understand-- [breaks off as something else catches his eye; he looks to see another group of spiders scurrying away over the wall and out a window; as he walks to the window, watching the spiders, Filch returns, accompanied by Professor McGonagall; she gasps in shock at the sight of Justin and approaches him, then glances from his body to Harry] Professor. I swear, I didn't.
Professor McGonagall: This is out of my hands, Potter. [she and Harry then walk to an opening containing a griffin statue, the entrance to Professor Dumbledore's office] Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. [she gestures towards the statue; Harry approaches] Sherbet Lemon. [she opens her hands at the statue; the statue rotates clockwise and rises, and a staircase comes out of the floor, also rising in a clockwise fashion; Harry steps onto the staircase, stepping towards a door as the statue comes to a stop]
Polyjuice Potion
[It is Christmas, and students going home for the holidays are transported across the frozen lake in sleighs pulled by white horses.]
Harry and Ron Transformed
[Harry and Ron walk down a staircase to a corridor.]
The Diary
[A thunderclap illuminates the dark sky outside.]
Tom Riddle
[Harry materializes in the Hogwarts Entrance Hall, which doesn't look any different than in the present.]
Petrified
Harry: It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
Cornelius Fudge
[Harry and Ron, under the Invisibility Cloak, approach Hagrid's cabin at night. They knock at the door; Fang looks up, Hagrid puts the lid on his teapot and readies his crossbow.]
Hagrid: Who's there? [walking to his front door and gently kicking it open] Hello? Hello? [Harry and Ron remove the cloak, Hagrid lowers it at the sight of them]
Harry: What's that for?
Hagrid: Oh, nothing, I was expecting, uh... it doesn't matter. Come on in, I just made a pot of tea. [he pours tea into a cup all the way to the brim]
Harry: Hagrid, are you okay?
Hagrid: I'm fine. I'm all right. [puts the teapot down]
Harry: Di-did you hear about Hermione?
Hagrid: Oh yeah. I heard about that all right.
Harry: Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
Hagrid: What you have to understand about that is... [there is another knock at the door; Harry and Ron turn towards the door as Fang barks] [whispering] Quick. Under the cloak. Don't say a word, be quiet, both of you. [Harry and Ron go into a corner, where Ron throws the cloak back over them; Hagrid pushes open the door, to find Dumbledore at the door, accompanied by another older gentleman, Cornelius Fudge] Oh, Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: [as Fudge gives Hagrid a slight greeting smile] Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?
Hagrid: Of course. [beckons them] Come in, come in.
Ron: [recognizes Fudge as he enters and whispers] That's dad's boss, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic.
Aragog
[Harry and Ron exit the cabin and glance to their left at the window, to see the spiders scurrying out the window, down the side of the house, towards the Forbidden Forest.]
Harry: Come on.
Ron: [fearfully] What?
Harry: You heard what Hagrid said: "Follow the spiders."
Ron: They're heading to the Dark Forest! [Harry walks towards the forest, carrying Hagrid's lantern; Ron reluctantly follows] Why spiders? Why couldn't it be "follow the butterflies"?
Spider attack
[Numerous spiders are descending from a massive hive high above towards Harry and Ron.]
Harry: [glancing at Aragog again] Well... thank you. We'll just... go.
Aragog: Go? [Ron nods fearfully] I think not. [more spiders emerge from around him] My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. [as hundreds more spiders appear from the trees] Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Ron: [glancing at Harry in terror] Can we panic now? [a big spider lands right next to the boys; Ron points his wand at it in fear, while Harry swings the lantern at it, then at another spider before throwing the lantern to the ground and taking out his wand before he and Ron stand back to back as the spiders surround them] Know any spells?
Harry: One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Ron: Where's Hermione when you need her?
[The spiders inch closer to the boys. At the moment, the sound of a car engine is heard; Harry and Ron look in the direction of the noise, to see the Ford Anglia drive into Aragog's nest, towards them; they back away towards Aragog as the car comes to a stop, then opens its doors for them.]
Harry: Let's go! [they run for the car; a pair of spiders come in for the attack; Ron whimpers as he gets in on the driver's side, closing the door on a spider's leg, but manages to pull itself free; Harry points his wand at the other spider as he reaches the passenger's door] Arania Exumai! [a beam emits from his wand, blasting the spider away; Harry gets in the car and closes the door, one spider lands on top of the car, while another lands on the hood] Go!
[Ron puts the car in reverse, and it backs away as fast as it can, as they go under a tree root, the spider on the roof falls off onto its back. The car then goes flying backwards over a hill.]
Harry and Ron: Whoa! [as the car lands on the forest floor, the spider on the hood falls off; the car then comes to a stop]
Ron: [grips the steering wheel, then turns to face Harry] Glad we're out of there.
[Suddenly, another spider climbs onto the car, and sticks its head through the window; Harry jumps as the spider goes for Ron, putting its pincers around his neck; taking his hands off the steering wheel, Ron tries to get the spider off, squirming and screaming. Harry calmly reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wand, and points it at his frightened friend. Ron, his eyes and nostrils wide with terror, moves to the left, giving Harry a clear shot at the spider trying to eat him.]
Harry: Arania Exumai! [a beam of white light emits from Harry's wand, blasting the spider off Ron and away from the car]
Ron: [glancing out the window and turning to Harry again] Thanks for that.
Harry: [putting his wand back in his pocket] Don't mention it. [looks out the windshield as a twitching sound is heard and squints; the spiders appear at the top of the hill, and begin moving towards the car; seeing the spiders, Ron whimpers] Get us out of here. Now! [Ron puts the car in reverse] Come on! Come on, move faster! [the boys scream as Ron makes a sharp turn] Come on, go! [Ron puts the car in drive, and steps on the gas; as they drive through the forest, the spiders pursue the car, moving almost as fast as cheetahs] Get us in the air.
Ron: [pushing the gear] The flying gear's jammed! [the spiders gather at a tree branch up ahead, intent on intercepting the Ford Anglia]
Harry: Come on. Pull!
Ron: I'm trying!
[As they drive into the pack of spiders, knocking them aside, the car takes the air, with one spider managing to grab hold of the car before falling to the ground. Flying over the trees, the car descends and lands a few feet from Hagrid's house before coming to a complete stop in front of the house; Harry opens his car door and lets Fang out.]
Ron: [evidently furious that Hagrid had to put them in such danger] "Follow the spiders". "Follow the spiders"! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him. [the Ford Anglia backs up as Fang reenters Hagrid's house, then drives past Harry and Ron, and back into the forest again] I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
Harry: We know one thing: Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets; he was innocent.
Missing
[The next day, Harry and Ron are visiting Hermione in the Hospital Wing again; Harry takes the old dried up flowers out of the vase next to Hermione's bed, puts in some new white flowers (most likely roses), then sits on the bed.]
Harry: Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever.
[Hermione just lays there with her glossy facial expression as Ron sighs sadly. Harry rubs Hermione's left hand; feeling something in it, he looks down and removes his hand to discover a crumpled up piece of paper, a library book page, which he carefully removes and straightens out.]
Ron: [glancing at the page] What's that?
Harry: [examining the page] Ron, this is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. [glances at the page and then back at Ron as he gets up] Come on! [Harry and Ron walk through the corridor as Harry reads from the page] "Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it..." [looking up at Ron] Ron, this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
Ron: [processing the information they just read] But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Harry: [thinking for a few seconds then looking at the window] Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. [they walk along as they go over how each of the victims were petrified] Colin saw it through his camera. Justin... Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost. He couldn't die again. And Hermione... had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
Ron: And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
Harry: [thinking about how Mrs. Norris got petrified, then remembering] The water... There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection. [Ron nods; Harry takes another look at the page, then walks to a nearby torch to more easily read the page, running his finger along it as he reads] "Spiders flee before it." It all fits.
Ron: But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake, someone would've seen it.
Harry: [as he and Ron glance at the bottom of the page where the word "Pipes" is written] Hermione's answered that, too.
Ron: Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
Harry: Remember what Aragog said about that girl fifty years ago, she died in a bathroom? What if she never left?
Ron: Moaning Myrtle. [Harry nods]
Professor McGonagall: [on the speakers] All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. [Ron glances at Harry in surprise, wondering what could be going on now] All teachers to the second floor corridor immediately.
[Harry and Ron hurry to the second floor corridor. In the section where the bloody message is, Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, Madam Pomfrey, and Filch run up to the wall, where Professor McGonagall directs their attention to a newly written message.]
Professor McGonagall: As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. [Harry and Ron walk into the corridor behind them] Our worst fear has been realized, a student has been taken by the monster, into the Chamber itself. [sadly looks at the others] The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
Lockhart: [happily walking up to the group] So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? [grins at Snape and McGonagall]
Snape: A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
Lockhart: [slightly stunned] My... moment?
Snape: Weren't you saying just last night you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? [Lockhart looks bewildered]
Professor McGonagall: That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend.
Lockhart: Very well. I'll just be in my office, getting, uh... getting ready. [turns and walks away; Filch watches him, then glances at Madam Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall]
Madam Pomfrey: Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?
Professor McGonagall: [glances at her] Ginny Weasley. [Harry and Ron straighten up in shock; Ron quavers slightly]
[Professor McGonagall sadly walks away, along with the other staff; a second later, Snape follows them, revealing the newly written message, which reads "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever".]
Ron: [reads the message with dread in his voice] "Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever." [Harry looks at Ron as he's becoming all the more devastated by his sister's abduction] Ginny...
Chamber of Secrets
Harry: [as he and Ron race into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and up the stairs to Lockhart’s office] Lockhart may be useless, but he’s going to try to get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know! [opening the door to the office and stepping inside] Professor, we have some information for you. [Lockhart stuffs some clothes into his trunk, which he closes as he turns toward them; Ron scowls at him] Are you going somewhere?
Lockhart: Um... well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Uh, got to go.
Ron: [outraged] What about my sister?!
Lockhart: Uh, well, um... As to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I.
Ron: [in disbelief] You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. You can’t go now!
Lockhart: [as he stuffs his things in his handbag then moves around his desk] Well, I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the job description about--
Harry: [blocking his path] You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?!
Lockhart: Books can be misleading.
Harry: You wrote them!
Lockhart: [placing his bag on his desk] My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!
Harry: [staring at Lockhart] You're a fraud. You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
Ron: [as Lockhart directs his attention to him] Is there anything you can do?
Lockhart: Yes. Now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with memory charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing, and I'd never have sold another book. [Harry and Ron look at each other as Lockhart walks toward his suitcase] In fact, uh... I'm uh... [Ron nods at Harry, and they both reach into their robes to pull out their wands] going to have to do the same to you. [he collects his wand from the suitcase, but Harry and Ron already have their wands trained on him]
Harry: Don't even think about it. [points downward, gesturing for Lockhart to drop his wand; Lockhart reluctantly does so]
[In her bathroom, Moaning Myrtle is floating around crying as Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter.]
Myrtle: Oh? Who's there? [seeing Harry, she smiles warmly at him] Oh, hello, Harry. What do you want?
Harry: To ask you how you died.
Myrtle: [smiles slightly] Oh... [her smile fades] ...it was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then... I heard somebody come in.
Harry: Who was it, Myrtle?
Myrtle: [choked up] I don't know. I was distraught! [floats towards the three] But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language, and I realized it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away, and... I died.
Harry: Just like that? How?
Myrtle: I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes, over there, by that sink. [points at the circle of sinks in the center of the bathroom]
[As Myrtle floats off to the stalls, Harry steps forward to examine the sinks. Reaching up to the circular stone above the sinks, he moves his hand downward to the sink in front of him; he turns the tap, but no water comes out. At that second, something else catches his eye; looking more closely at the tap, he sees a snake carved on it.]
Harry: This is it. [taking a step back] This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. [Lockhart glances at the sink in surprise]
Ron: Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.
Harry: [after a few seconds] Hesha- Hassah. (Open up.)
[The circular stone above the sinks rises, then all the sinks begin to move outwards. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart back away slowly as the sinks move; the sink with the snake carved on its tap descends into the floor, then a grating slides over it. Lockhart steps towards the opening that the sinks concealed and looks down into a very wide black hole]
Lockhart: [inhales then turns to Harry with a grin] Excellent, Harry. Ah, good work. Well, then, I'll just be, uh... there's no need for me to stay. [he tries to run, but Harry and Ron grab hold of him]
Harry: Oh, yes there is! [with all their might, they push Lockhart backwards toward the passage before drawing their wands] You first.
Lockhart: Now, boys, what good will it do?
Ron: Better you than us. [Harry nods]
Lockhart: Um, but... obviously, yes. [he nervously turns around and grips the sinks as he looks down into the passage before glancing over his shoulder at the boys again] Sure you don't want to test it first? [annoyed, Ron pokes Lockhart with his wand, sending him into the passage, screaming as he disappears into the darkness; a second later, a crash is heard as Harry and Ron walk up to the opening] It's really quite filthy down here.
Harry: All right. [turns to Ron] Let's go. [Ron nods in agreement]
Myrtle: Oh, Harry? [the two boys look up at her] If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. [she giggles; making Ron uneasy]
Harry: Uh... thanks, Myrtle. [smiles at her, then turns to the opening, and jumps into it; Ron immediately jumps in after him]
[Harry and Ron scream as they go down a slide, which leads to a small pit filled with animal bones, most likely the Basilisk's feeding area, as Lockhart brushes the dirt off his robes when the boys land. They immediately get to feet and point their wands at him.]
Ron: [glancing at the muck around them] Ugh.
Harry: [stepping on the bones] Now, remember: any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. [he turns and goes into the passageway behind him]
Ron: Go on. [Lockhart reluctantly follows Harry into the passage with Ron right behind him]
Backfire
Harry: [coming to another passageway to the right, he beckons Ron and Lockhart to follow him] This way. [the three walk into a cavern-like room with a massive and lengthy snakeskin on the floor]
Ron: [[as Harry walks along the snakeskin] What's this?
Lockhart: [feeling nervous] It looks like a... snake.
Harry: [as he examines it] It's a snakeskin.
Ron: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long. Or more. [Lockhart faints, most likely from fear] [sarcastically as Harry turns his attention to Lockhart] Heart of a lion, this one.
Lockhart: [suddenly grabbing Ron's wand and getting to his feet while breathing wickedly and pointing the wand at Harry] The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl, [points the wand at Ron] how you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So... [points the wand at Harry again] ...you first, Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. [waves the wand wildly as he shouts] Obliviate!
[The wand emits green light, causing Lockhart to fly backwards, slam into the wall, then fall to the floor. A couple seconds later, a rumbling begins, then rocks begin to fall from the ceiling; Harry takes cover as huge rocks go flying over him while Ron backs up against the wall as the rocks form a massive pile.]
Ron: [coughing from the dust produced by the rocks] Harry! [Harry pulls his robe free from one of the rocks] Harry!
Harry: [running to a opening in the big pile of rocks separating him from Ron] Ron! Ron, are you okay?
Ron: I'm fine!
Lockhart: [groans and sits up] Hello. Who are you?
Ron: Um... Ron Weasley.
Lockhart: Really? And, uh... who-who am I?
Ron: [realizing Lockhart has erased his own memory by accident, he turns toward Harry again] Lockhart's memory charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!
Lockhart: [picks up a small rock as Harry watches through the opening] It's an odd sort of place this is, isn't it? [tosses the rock in his hand then glances at Ron] Do you live here?
Ron: [taking the rock from Lockhart] No.
Lockhart: Really? [Ron smacks Lockhart on the back of the head with the rock, knocking him out; Harry winks slightly]
Ron: [glancing at Harry through the opening again] What do I do now?
Harry: You wait here, and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. I'll go on and find Ginny.
Ron: [as Harry turns and climbs down from the pile of rocks] Okay.
[Harry draws his wand as he steps onto the floor again and walks forward. Up ahead, he sees a circular door with seven snake-shaped locks on it, and steps towards it.]
Harry: Hesha- Hassah. (Open.)
[An eighth snake slithers out from the door's mechanical hinge, and slithers along the door's edge, causing the other seven snakes to retract one by one. As the snake slithers back into the hinge, the door slowly opens. Harry steps forward; on the other side is the Chamber of Secrets. Harry cautiously steps through the door, into the Chamber, towards the ladder in the doorway.]
Heir of Slytherin
[As the door slowly closes behind him, Harry climbs down the ladder and walks down the corridor. Looking ahead, he sees Ginny lying motionless at the end of the Chamber.]
Harry: Ginny. [runs to her, drops his wand and gets on his knees] Ginny. No, Ginny. Please don’t be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please wake up.
[Suddenly, Tom Riddle walks out of a nearby doorway.]
Riddle: She won’t wake.
[Harry recognizes his voice and turns toward him. Riddle walks to him.]
Harry: Tom? Tom Riddle? What do you mean she won’t wake? She’s not...?
Riddle: She’s still alive, but only just.
Harry: Are you a ghost?
Riddle: A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.
Harry: [reaches out and touches Ginny] She's as cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. [while Harry's not looking, Riddle bends down and picks up Harry's wand from where he left it] You've got to help me, Tom. There's a Basilisk.
Riddle: It won't come until it's called.
Harry: [looks up to see Riddle holding his wand and stands up] Give me my wand, Tom.
Riddle: You won't be needing it.
Harry: Listen, we've got to go. We've got to save her!
Riddle: I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. [Harry looks at him, confused] Yes, Harry. It was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. [Ginny is shown standing in front of the sink in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom as it opens]
Harry: No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
Riddle: It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. [Ginny is show using her blood-covered fingers to write on the wall]
Harry: But why?
Riddle: Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. [as Ginny is shown running into a stall and throwing the diary into the toilet] Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then, who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
Harry: [stands in front of the Slytherin statue] And why did you want to meet me?
Riddle: I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
Harry: [angrily] Hagrid's my friend! [calms down slightly] And you framed him, didn't you?
Riddle: It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
Harry: [smirks at him] I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Riddle: He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. [walks around Harry as he speaks] I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, I would be able to lead another, to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Harry: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Riddle: [smiles maliciously] Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target has been you. [Harry looks at him in surprise] How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape [pushes Harry's hair aside with his wand to see his scar] with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Harry: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
Riddle: [smiles wickedly] Voldemort is... my past, present, and future. [turns toward the statue and uses Harry's wand to write his full name in flaming letters; after writing the "E", he flicks the wand, and the letters rearrange themselves to say "I AM LORD VOLDEMORT]
Harry: [as the letters fade and Riddle turns to face him] You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. [Riddle stares evilly at Harry] You're Voldemort.
Riddle: Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Harry: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
Riddle: Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
Harry: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! [Harry and Riddle glare at each other; a musical sound is heard nearby; Harry and Riddle look down the corridor to see Fawkes flying towards them, carrying something] Fawkes? [Fawkes drops a bundled-up object into Harry's hands as he flies over and around them, then back down the corridor; Harry unrolls the object, which turns out to be the Sorting Hat]
Riddle: So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender: A songbird and an old hat. [backs away from Harry as he continues examining the Sorting Hat, then walks toward the Slytherin statue and extends his left hand] Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine. (Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts four.)
The Basilisk
[Harry turns to face the statue of Salazar Slytherin as a rumbling begins; Riddle turns around to face him as the statue's mouth starts to open.]
Riddle: Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter.
[Harry gulps and turns toward the statue again as he hears an ominous snarling that appears to be coming from inside the statue and hyperventilates; Riddle turns to face the statue's mouth as the Basilisk shrieks "Hungry!" from within the statue. The stone slab concealing the statue's mouth stops descending; a split second afterwards, the Basilisk emerges from the darkness and starts to come into the light, growling menacingly. Harry throws the Sorting Hat onto the floor in front of Ginny and races back towards the door to the Chamber as the Basilisk's head comes out of the statue's mouth and its snake-like body lowers into the surrounding water; Riddle, immune to the Basilisk's lethal gaze, watches the creature.]
Riddle: Sethae- He- This! (Kill him!) [turns his attention to the fleeing Harry] Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. [the Basilisk's tail drops into the water behind him] It only obeys me!
[The Basilisk slithers after Harry with a ferocious growl; Harry races down the corridor as fast as he can while the Basilisk is in hot pursuit; unfortunately, Harry loses his footing on the slippery floor and trips, allowing the Basilisk to catch up with him. His glasses clatter to the floor in front of him; he immediately puts them back on before realizing the Basilisk is right above him. Just as the Basilisk is about to attack Harry, Fawkes emits his cry, getting their attention. Fawkes swoops down, going directly for the Basilisk, and attacks the colossal snake, pecking at it, with Harry observing their fight by watching their shadows on the wall.]
Riddle: No! Your bird may have blinded the Basilisk, but it can still hear you.
[Harry turns around to see that the Basilisk's yellow eyes are bloody. The Basilisk thrashes around furiously as Fawkes flies off; Harry gets to his feet, and steps backwards, stepping into something slimy, causing a splattering sound; Harry looks down to see what he stepped in. At the same time, the Basilisk stops thrashing about and blindly glares at Harry, who looks up again and makes a run for a passageway to his right. The Basilisk lunges at Harry, nearly getting him. Harry, breathing heavily, runs as fast as he can, into a tunnel just to his left as the Basilisk lunges at him again, smashing through a stalactite. Harry runs through the tunnel, looking back to see if the Basilisk is still behind him; he turns left into an alcove, only to find his path blocked by a grate. He struggles to move it, but turns around upon hearing the Basilisk coming into the tunnel. He steps back against the grate, as the Basilisk comes to his position. The Basilisk hisses at him and approaches him with its mouth open. Harry picks up a rock at his feet and throws it; the sound of the rock distracts the Basilisk, who slithers off into another passageway. Harry races back into the Chamber where Riddle and Ginny are.]
Riddle: Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. [Harry puts his hand on Ginny's hand again] In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. [Harry looks up at him] Lord Voldemort will return... very... much... alive.
Harry: [glancing at Ginny again] Ginny...
[The Basilisk bursts out of the water surrounding the Slytherin statue and thrashes about; Harry turns toward the Sorting Hat, where a sword magically appears. Harry, without hesitation, grabs the sword and holds it up defensively as the Basilisk slithers toward him. Harry races for the statue and begins to climb it; the Basilisk blindly follows Harry's movements, using its tongue to track his location and lifts its body off the floor. The Basilisk uses its tongue again to find Harry's current position directly in front of it; Harry swings the sword at the Basilisk; it lunges directly at him, he dodges, and it smashes right into the statue. Harry climbs higher as the Basilisk lunges at him again, missing again; Harry climbs onto the top of the statue's head, the Basilisk lunges at Harry repeatedly as he swings the sword wildly at the creature. Eventually, the Basilisk sends Harry rolling down the side of the statue, causing him to lose the sword.]
Harry: [seeing the sword about to slide off the top of the statue's head] No.
[Harry hurries to retrieve the sword; the Basilisk lunges right at Harry once more. Harry stops the sword just in time, and rams it right through the Basilisk's upper jaw. The Basilisk bellows in pain until Harry pulls the sword out. Harry screams in pain as one of the Basilisk's venomous fangs just fell into his arm; he pulls the fang out, unfortunately, the venom is already in his bloodstream. The Basilisk thrashes around, roaring and bellowing in pain, collapsing under its weight, and falls backwards to the floor, dead, splashing water everywhere; Riddle stares at the Basilisk's corpse in disbelief.]
Healing Powers
[Harry limps past the Basilisk's corpse, and, dropping the sword and falling to his knees, he crawls towards Ginny once more as Riddle walks toward them.]
Riddle: Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body. I guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. [Harry extends his left hand to Ginny's again] Funny... the damage a silly little book can do... especially in the hands of a silly little girl. [Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's arm and carefully pulls it out, placing it on the floor between her and the Basilisk fang] What are you doing? [Harry picks up the Basilisk fang and holds it up while staring at Riddle, who immediately realizes what Harry is about to do] Stop. No!
[Harry stabs one of the diary's pages with the fang as Riddle steps forward to try and stop him; Riddle's body crumbles and gives a discharge of yellow light; ink starts to ooze from the diary, Riddle recoils and growls with rage; Harry pries the fang out. Riddle attempts to attack, but Harry stabs the other page, crippling Riddle, and causing him to crumble further; Harry closes the diary and stabs the cover with the Basilisk fang; Riddle screams in agony and disintegrates into yellow particles; shortly after Riddle's demise, Ginny awakens, hyperventilating, and sits up.]
Harry: Ginny.
Ginny: [turning to face him] Harry, it was me. But, I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. And... [notices Harry's injury] Harry... you're hurt.
Harry: [covering his wound] Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. [Fawkes emits his song again; Harry and Ginny both look down the corridor to see him flying towards them; he swoops around the Basilisk's body, and lands in between them, then steps over to Harry] You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. [Fawkes emits a soft grunt, then lowers his head to Harry's wound, and cries on it; the wound miraculously disappears; Ginny stares in amazement] Of course! [lifting his healed arm] Phoenix tears have healing powers. [Fawkes grunts affirmatively as Harry glances at him] Thanks. [looks at Ginny] It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.
[Fawkes then flies Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny out of the Chamber of Secrets.]
Lockhart: Amazing! This is just like magic!
[Fawkes carries the four of them up towards the opening of a cave as the moon can be seen above them.]
Out of the Hat
[Harry and Ron stand before Professor Dumbledore in his office, with Fawkes on his perch, and the sword and Sorting Hat resting on the desk.]
Professor Dumbledore: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours, you have broken, perhaps, a dozen school rules.
Harry and Ron: Yes, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Harry and Ron: Yes, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: Therefore, it is only fitting... [Harry and Ron look up] that you both receive special awards for services to the school. [Harry and Ron look at each other with smiles, then back at Dumbledore again]
Ron: Thanks, sir.
Professor Dumbledore: [smiles at the boys, then stands up while handing some papers to Ron] And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we... we want our gamekeeper back. [turns to Harry as Ron leaves the room] Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must've shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could've called Fawkes to you. And, second... I sense something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
Harry: You see, sir. I couldn't help but notice certain things... certain... certain similarities between... Tom Riddle and me.
Professor Dumbledore: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because, Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
Harry: [amazed] Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?
Professor Dumbledore: Uh-huh. Not intentionally. But yes.
Harry: [as Dumbledore returns to his seat behind the desk] So, the Sorting Hat was right; I should be in Slytherin.
Professor Dumbledore: It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes: Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
Harry: [glancing at the Sorting Hat] Because I asked it to.
Professor Dumbledore: Exactly, Harry, exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest you look more closely [picks up the sword] at this. [Harry takes the sword by the blade with his left hand, and its hilt with his right] Be careful.
Harry: [examines the sword and sees the name "Godric Gryffindor" on the Basilisk venom-coated blade] Godric Gryffindor.
Professor Dumbledore: Ah. It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. [Harry looks at Dumbledore]
Dobby's Reward
[The door to the office opens, Dumbledore glances past Harry, who turns around; Lucius Malfoy steps in to the office, standing behind him is Dobby.]
Harry: Dobby! So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys.
Dobby: [nervously looking at Harry] Mm-hmm. [fearfully glances up at Lucius]
Lucius: [through clenched teeth] I'll deal with you later. [Dobby cowers and whimpers; Lucius pulls out his walking stick and walks toward Dumbledore's desk, followed by Dobby; as he walks up the steps, he coldly uses the stick to push Harry aside] Out of my way, Potter. So... it's true. You have returned.
Professor Dumbledore: When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
Lucius: [angrily] Ridiculous!
Welcome Back
[It is the end of year feast; Nearly Headless Nick, now revitalized, floats along the row between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables in the Great Hall.]
Female Student: Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!
Nearly Headless Nick: Thank you.
Another Female Student: Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
Nearly Headless Nick: Good evening.
Male Student: Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
Nearly Headless Nick: Thank you. [glancing at another pair of students] Hello. [reaching the doors to the Great Hall, he passes Filch, who is just happy to have Mrs. Norris back, and Hermione walks in as he turns toward her] Hermione! Welcome back.
Hermione: Thanks, Sir Nicholas. [Nearly Headless Nick floats away as Hermione glances at the Gryffindor table]
{Harry Potter whispering} Lumos Maxima.

Lumos Maxima.

Lumos Maxima.

Lumos Maxima.

Lumos Maxima!

PETUNIA: Harry! Harry!

Harry, open the door!

Marge! How lovely to see...

HARRY: Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form.

VERNON: What is it?

HARRY: Nothing. School stuff.

VERNON: Later perhaps, if you behave.

HARRY: I will if she does.

MARGE: Oh, you're still here, are you?

HARRY: Yes.

MARGE: Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.

Damn good of my brother to keep you.

He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

Is that my Dudders?

Is that my little neffy-pooh?

Give us a kiss! Come on! Up, up!

VERNON: Take Marge's suitcase upstairs!

HARRY: Okay.

MARGE: Finish that off for Mommy.

Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

VERNON: Can I tempt you, Marge?

MARGE: Just a small one.

Excellent nosh, Petunia.

A bit more.

Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.

Just a bit more. That's a boy! Mm!

You wanna try a little drop of brandy?

A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

What are you smirking at?

Where did you send the boy, Vernon?

VERNON: St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.

MARGE: Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?

HARRY: Oh, yeah.

Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

MARGE: Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby... wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.

You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.

It's all to do with blood.

Bad blood will out.

What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?

PETUNIA: Nothing. He didn't work.

He was unemployed.

MARGE: And a drunk too, no doubt?

HARRY: That's a lie!

MARGE: What did you say?

HARRY: My dad wasn't a drunk!

MARGE: Oh, don't worry Don't fuss, Petunia.

I have a very firm grip.

VERNON: I think it's time you went to bed.

MARGE: Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.

It's all to do with the mother.

You see it all the time with dogs.

If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup.

HARRY: Shut up! Shut up!

MARGE: Mm.

Right!

Let me tell you... y-y--

Vernon!

Vernon! Vernon, do something!

VERNON: Ow! Ripper! Ow!

Ripper, get down, boy! Down! Ripper, stop it!

Stop!

I've got you, Marge! I've got you!

Hold on, hold on!

Get off!

MARGE: Don't you dare!

VERNON: Sorry!

PETUNIA: Oh, Vernon!

VERNON: Oh, God!

Marge!

Please!

Marge!

Come back!

You bring her back!

You bring her back now and you put her right!

HARRY: No! She deserved what she got!

Keep away from me.

VERNON: You're not allowed to do magic outside school.

HARRY: Yeah? Try me.

VERNON: They won't let you back now.

You've nowhere to go.

HARRY: I don't care.

Anywhere's better than here.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Help, would you!

"Welcome to the Knight Bus... emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.

My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening."

What you doing down there?

HARRY: I fell over.

STAN SHUNPIKE: What you fall over for?

HARRY: I didn't do it on purpose.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Well, come on, then.

Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

What you looking at?

HARRY: Nothing.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Well, come on, then. In.

No, no, no. I'll get this.

You get in.

Come on.

Come on. Move on, move on.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Take her away, Ern.

SHRUNKEN HEAD: Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

It's going to be a bumpy ride.

STAN SHUNPIKE: What did you say your name was?

HARRY: I didn't.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Whereabouts are you headed?

HARRY: The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

STAN SHUNPIKE: You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.

That's in London."

SHRUNKEN HEAD: The Leaky Cauldron.

If you have pea soup... make sure you eat it before it eats you.

HARRY: But the Muggles. Can't they see us?

STAN SHUNPIKE: Muggles?

They don't see nothing, do they?

SHRUNKEN HEAD: No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.

Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

Ten, nine, eight... seven, six, five... four, three, three and a half... two, one and three quarters.

Yes!

HARRY: Who is that?

That man.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Who is that?

Who is...?

That is Sirius Black, that is.

Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.

He's a murderer.

Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.

HARRY: How did he escape?

STAN SHUNPIKE: Well, that's the question, isn't it?

He's the first one that done it.

He was a big supporter of... You-Know-Who.

I reckon you've heard of him.

HARRY: Yeah.

Him I've heard of.

SHRUNKEN HEAD: Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.

They're getting closer, Ernie.

Ernie, they're right on top of us!

Mind your head.

Hey, guys? Guys?

Why the long faces?

Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

The Leaky Cauldron.

Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

TOM: Mr. Potter, at last.

STAN SHUNPIKE: Take it away, Ern.

SHRUNKEN HEAD: Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

Room 11.

HARRY: Hedwig.

Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.

He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.

FUDGE: As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter... earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located... a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.

The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately.

She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.

She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.

So that's that... and no harm done.

Pea soup?

HARRY: No, thank you.

Minister?

FUDGE: Yes?

HARRY: I don't understand.

FUDGE: Understand?

HARRY: I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.

FUDGE: Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban... for blowing up their aunts.

On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things... was very, very irresponsible.

HARRY: "The state of things," sir?

FUDGE: We have a killer on the loose.

HARRY: Sirius Black, you mean?

But what's he got to do with me?

FUDGE: Nothing, of course. You're safe.

And that's what matters.

And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.

These are your new schoolbooks.

I took the liberty... of having them brought here.

Now Tom will show you to your room.

HARRY: Hedwig.

FUDGE: Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't... wander.

Right! You gonna move that bus or what?

MAID: Housekeeping.

I'll come back later.

RON: I'm warning you, Hermione.

Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

HERMIONE: It's a cat, Ronald.

What do you expect?

It's in his nature.

RON: A cat? Is that what they told you?

Looks like a pig with hair.

HERMIONE: That's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.

Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.

Harry.

RON: Harry.

HARRY: Egypt. What's it like?

RON: Brilliant. Loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

Egyptians used to worship cats.

Along with the dung beetle.

FRED/GEORGE: Not flashing that clipping again?

RON: I haven't shown anyone.

No, not a soul.

Not unless you count Tom.

The day maid.

Night maid.

Cook.

The bloke who fixed the toilet.

MOLLY: Harry.

HARRY: Mrs. Weasley.

MOLLY: Good to see you, dear.

HARRY: Good to see you.

Got everything?

Yes.

Yes? All your books?

It's all upstairs.

Your clothes?

Everything.

Good boy.

Thank you.

Harry Potter.

Mr. Weasley.

Harry, wonder if I might have a word?

Yeah, sure.

Hermione.

Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

Looking forward to a new term?

Yeah. It should be great.

Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me... from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.

But I think that you need to know the facts.

You are in danger.

Grave danger.

Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?

What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?

Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.

Do you know why?

Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...

Voldemort.

Don't say his name.

Sorry.

When you stopped You-Know-Who... Black lost everything.

But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.

And in his mind... you are the only thing that stands in the way... of You-Know-Who returning to power.

And that is why... he has escaped from Azkaban.

To find you.

And kill me.

Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear... you won't go looking for Black.

Mr. Weasley... why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?

Quick. Quick.

Ron, Ron!

Oh, for goodness' sake!

Don't lose him!

I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

I lost control.

Brilliant.

Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.

Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

I was lucky not to be arrested.

I still think it was brilliant.

Come on. Everywhere else is full.

Who do you think that is?

Professor R.J. Lupin.

Do you know everything?

How is it she knows everything?

It's on his suitcase, Ronald.

Oh.

Do you think he's really asleep?

Seems to be. Why?

I gotta tell you something.

Let me get this straight.

Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban... to come after you?

Yeah.

But they'll catch Black, won't they?

I mean, everyone's looking for him.

Sure.

Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.

Thanks, Ron.

Why are we stopping?

We can't be there yet.

What's going on?

I don't know.

Maybe we've broken down.

Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

There's something moving out there.

I think someone's coming aboard.

Bloody hell! What's happening?

Harry.

Harry, are you all right?

Thank you.

Here, eat this. It'll help.

It's all right. It's chocolate.

What was that thing that came?

It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.

It was searching the train for Sirius Black.

If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.

Eat. You'll feel better.

What happened to me?

Well, you sort of went rigid.

We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.

And did either of you two... you know... pass out?

No.

I felt weird, though.

Like I'd never be cheerful again.

But someone was screaming.

A woman.

No one was screaming, Harry.

Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.

Now, I'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.

First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

Good luck, professor.

Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.

Potter. Is it true you fainted?

I mean, you actually fainted?

Shove off, Malfoy.

How did he find out?

Just forget it.

Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.

Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

Finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the Ministry of Magic... Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban... until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.

The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.

Now whilst I've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution.

Dementors are vicious creatures.

They'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.

Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you.

It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.

But you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light.

Fortuna Major.

Here, listen.

She just won't let me in.

Fortuna Major.

No, no, no. Wait, wait.

Watch this.

Oh, amazing! Just with my voice.

Fortuna Major.

Yes, all right. Go in.

Thank you.

Still doing that after three years.

She can't even sing.

Exactly.

Hey, man.

Hey, man.

Oh, God.

That's awful.

Green. That's a monkey.

What is that?

You call that a monkey?

Do not give him one again.

Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

Ron, catch.

I will.

I think we have a winner.

Oh, don't try one of them.

Oh, no.

Look at him. His face.

Welcome, my children.

In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.

In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.

Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.

This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.

So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.

What do you see?

The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.

But first, you must broaden your minds.

First, you must look beyond.

What a load of rubbish.

Where did you come from?

Me?

I've been here all this time.

You, boy...

Is your grandmother quite well?

I think so.

I wouldn't be so sure of that.

Give me the cup.

Pity.

Broaden your minds.

Your aura is pulsing, dear.

Are you in the beyond?

I think you are.

Sure.

Look at the cup.

Tell me what you see.

Yeah.

Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.

That's trials and suffering.

And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.

So... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.

Give me the cup.

Oh, my dear boy.

My dear... you have the Grim.

The Grin? What's the Grin?

Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

It's among the darkest omens in our world.

It's an omen... of death."

You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?

Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a woolly discipline.

Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.

Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?

A fair few.

Hang on. That's not possible.

Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.

You have to be in two classes at once.

Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?

"Broaden your minds. Use your Inner Eye to see the future."

That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.

Less talking, if you don't mind.

I got a real treat for you today.

A great lesson. So follow me.

Right, you lot. Less chattering.

Form a group over there.

And open your books to page 49.

Exactly how do we do that?

Just stroke the spine, of course.

Goodness me.

Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.

I'm okay. Okay.

I think they're funny.

Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.

Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.

Shut up, Malfoy.

Dementor! Dementor!

Just ignore him.

You're supposed to stroke it.

Yeah.

Isn't he beautiful?

Say hello to Buckbeak.

Hagrid, exactly what is that?

That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.

Very easily offended.

You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

It may be the last thing you ever do.

Now, who'd like to come and say hello?

Well done, Harry. Well done.

Come on now.

Now... you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So... step up. Give him a nice bow.

Then you wait and see if he bows back.

If he does, you can go and touch him.

If not... Well, we'll get to that later.

Just make your bow.

Nice and low.

Back off, Harry. Back off.

Keep still.

Keep still.

Well done, Harry. Well done.

Here, you big brute, you.

Right. I think you can go and pat him now.

Go on. Don't be shy.

Nice and slow, now.

Nice and slow. Slow.

Not so fast, Harry.

Slow down, Harry. That's it...

Nice and slow.

Now let him come to you.

Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

That's it...

Yes!

Well done! Well done, Harry, well done!

Does he get to fly?

I think he may let you ride him now.

What?

Come on.

Hey, hey, hey!

Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.

Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.

Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak.

That was wicked, Harry!

Oh, please.

Well done, well done.

How am I doing me first day?

Brilliant, professor.

Yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!

Malfoy, no...

No!

Buckbeak!

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Whoa! Buckbeak!

Away, you silly creature!

It's killed me!

Calm down! It's just a scratch!

Hagrid!

He has to be taken to the hospital.

I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

You're gonna regret this.

Class dismissed!

You and your bloody chicken!

Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

It comes and it goes.

Still, I consider myself lucky.

Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.

I can't do homework for weeks.

Listen to the idiot.

He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?

At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

I hear Draco's father's furious.

We haven't heard the end of this.

He's been sighted!

Who?

Sirius Black!

Dufftown? That's not far from here.

You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?

With dementors at every entrance?

Dementors?

He slipped past them once.

Who's to say he won't do it again?

That's right. Black could be anywhere.

It's like trying to catch smoke.

Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.

Intriguing, isn't it?

Would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside?

That's a boggart, that is.

Very good, Mr. Thomas.

Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?

No one knows.

When did she get here?

Boggarts are shape-shifters.

They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.

That's what makes them so...

So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.

Let's practice it now.

Without wands, please.

After me. Riddikulus!

Riddikulus!

Very good.

A little louder and very clear.

Listen: Riddikulus!

Riddikulus!

This class is ridiculous.

Very good.

So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.

What really finishes a boggart is laughter.

You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.

Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?

Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

Come on.

Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?

Professor Snape.

Sorry?

Professor Snape.

Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

You live with your grandmother.

I don't want it to turn into her, either.

No... it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.

Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.

She carries a red handbag...

We don't need to hear.

As long as you see it, we'll see it.

Now, when I open that wardrobe... here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.

Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.

Can you do that?

Yes. Wand at the ready.

One, two, three.

Think, Neville, think.

Riddikulus!

Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!

Incredible! Okay... to the back, Neville.

Everyone, form a line!

Form a line!

I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny.

Next! Ron!

Concentrate. Face your fear.

Be brave!

Wand at the ready, Ron.

Riddikulus!

Yes!

You see? Very good, very good!

Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

Show us what you see.

Keep your nerve. Steady.

Riddikulus!

And next! Step up, step up!

Wonderful, wonderful!

Here!

Riddikulus!

Right. Sorry about that.

That's enough for today.

Collect your books from the back.

That's the end of the lesson.

Thank you! Sorry!

Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.

Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.

Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school... that privilege shall not be extended again.

No permission form signed, no visiting the village.

That's the rule, Potter.

Those with permission, follow me.

Those without, stay put.

I thought if you signed it, then I could...

I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.

Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.

I'm sorry, Potter.

That's my final word.

Forget about it, guys. See you later.

Professor, can I ask you something?

You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?

I thought it'd be obvious.

I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.

I did think of Voldemort at first.

But then I remembered that night on the train... and the dementor.

I'm very impressed.

That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.

This is very wise.

Before I fainted... I heard something.

A woman... screaming.

Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.

Our pain becomes their power.

I think it was my mother... the night she was murdered.

The very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.

Not by your scar, by your eyes.

They're your mother, Lily's.

Yes.

Oh, yes. I knew her.

Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.

Not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman.

She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.

And your father, James, on the other hand... he...

He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.

A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.

You're more like them than you know, Harry.

In time, you'll come to see just how much.

Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.

You heard it's the most...

Haunted building in Britain. I know.

What's going on?

Probably Neville forgot the password again.

Hey.

Oh, you're there.

Let me through, please.

Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

Get back, all of you.

No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.

The Fat Lady! She's gone!

Serves her right.

She was a terrible singer.

It's not funny, Ron.

Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.

Back to your common room.

Be quiet.

Make way.

The headmaster's here.

Come on, move.

You heard. Move!

Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

There's no need for ghosts, professor.

The Fat Lady's there.

Mind where you're going! Slow down!

You listen! I'm Head Boy!

Come back here!

Keep moving!

Dear lady, who did this to you?

Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.

It's him, headmaster.

The one they all talk about.

He's here, somewhere in the castle!

Sirius Black!

Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.

The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

Thank you.

The third floor's clear too, sir.

Very good.

I've done the dungeons.

No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.

I didn't really expect him to linger.

Remarkable feat, don't you think?

To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... completely undetected?

Quite remarkable, yes.

Any theories on how he managed it?

Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

You may recall... prior to the start of term I expressed concerns... about your appointment of Professor...

Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.

I'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.

What about Potter?

Should he be warned?

Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.

Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.

Turn to page 394.

Excuse me, sir.

Where's Professor Lupin?

That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?

Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time.

Turn to page 394.

"Werewolves"?

Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.

We're not meant to start that for weeks.

Quiet.

When did she come in?

Did you see her come in?

Now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an Animagus and a werewolf?

No one?

How disappointing.

Please, sir.

An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.

A werewolf has no choice.

With each full moon... he no longer remembers who he is.

He'd kill his best friend.

The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.

Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.

That's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.

Are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?

He's got a point, you know.

Five points from Gryffindor.

As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it.

It's Quidditch tomorrow.

Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter.

Loss of limb will not excuse you.

Page 394.

The term "werewolf"... is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"... which means "man," and "wolf."

Werewolf, man-wolf.

There are several ways to become a werewolf.

They include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf...

Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

Aresto momentum!

He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?

Peaky?

What do you expect?

He fell over 100 feet.

Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.

Probably a right sight better than he normally does.

How are you feeling?

Oh, brilliant.

You gave us a right good scare.

What happened?

Well, you fell off your broom.

Really? I meant the match. Who won?

No one blames you, Harry.

Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

After he saved you, he sent them off.

There's something else you should know too.

When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...

Well...

I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.

Is there no chance of fixing it?

No.

Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?

I mean, more than everyone else?

Listen.

Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.

They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.

You are not weak, Harry.

Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.

Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.

You have nothing to be ashamed of.

I'm scared, professor.

I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

I need to know how to fight them.

You could teach me.

You made the one on the train go away.

There was only one that night.

But you made it go away.

I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you... perhaps I should teach you.

But after the holidays.

For now, I need to rest.


Last call for Hogsmeade!

Come on, now!

Guys, let me go.

Clever, Harry.

But not clever enough.

We've got a better way.

I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.

We know.

We'll get you there.

We'll show you a quicker way.

Lf you pipe down.

Bless him.

Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

Now, Harry.

Come and join the big boys.

What are you doing?!

What's this rubbish?

"What's this rubbish?" he says.

It's the secret to our success.

It's a wrench giving it to you...

But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.

George, if you will.

I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs... are proud to present the Marauder's Map."

We owe them so much.

Hang on. This is Hogwarts.

And that...

No. Is that really...?

Dumbledore.

In his study.

Pacing.

Does that a lot.

So this map shows...

Everyone.

Where they are.

What they're doing.

Every minute.

Every day.

Brilliant! Where did you get it?

From Filch's office.

First year.

There are seven secret passageways... out of the castle.

We'd recommend this one.

The One-Eyed Witch passageway.

Leads you to Honeyduke's.

Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

And don't forget. When you're done, just give it a tap and say:

"Mischief managed."

Otherwise, anyone can read it.

Now, how much do you want?

Delicious.

It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?

Twice.

Do you want to move a bit closer?

To the Shrieking Shack?

Actually, I'm fine here.

Well, well. Look who's here.

You two shopping for your new dream home?

Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?

Don't your family sleep in one room?

Shut your mouth, Malfoy.

Not very friendly.

Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

Hope you don't mean yourself!

How dare you talk to me!

You filthy little mudblood!

Who is that?

Don't stand there! Do something!

What?

What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

Get out of the way!

Move!

Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

Harry!

Bloody hell, Harry.

That was not funny.

Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.

He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.

Aren't you?

Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

Ron fancies her.

That's not true!

Professor McGonagall!

Cornelius!

Allow me, minister.

Oh, Hagrid...

Sorry about that.

Rosmerta, my dear.

I hope business is good.

It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors... into my pub every other night!

We have...

We have a killer on the loose.

Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

And what would bring him here?

Harry Potter.

Harry Potter?

Come.

Harry!

No underage wizards allowed in today!

Shut the damn door!

So rude.

Thick heads.

Thick heads?!

How dare they!

Who are they calling thick heads?

Young whippersnappers!

Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.

Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.

Tell me what this is all about.

Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...

Remember? They hid.

Few knew where they were.

One who did was Sirius Black.

And he told You-Know-Who.

Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night... he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

Peter Pettigrew?

Little lump of a boy.

Always trailing after Black.

I remember.

Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.

What happened?

Peter tried to warn the Potters... and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

Black was vicious.

He didn't kill Pettigrew.

He destroyed him!

A finger. That's all that was left.

A finger. Nothing else.

Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters... but he's the reason they're dead.

He wants to finish things.

I don't believe it.

That's not the worst of it.

What could be worse?

This: Sirius Black was... and remains to this day... Harry Potter's godfather!

Ron, look!

Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.

Merry Christmas.

Harry, what happened?

He was their friend... and he betrayed them.

He was their friend!

I hope he finds me.

Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready!

When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

Harry.

There you are. You came.

Are you sure about this, Harry?

This is very advanced magic... well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level.

I'm sure.

Well, everything's prepared.

The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.

Did you ever hear of it?

No? Well...

A Patronus is a positive force.

For the wizard who conjures one... it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.

But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.

Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.

Can you do this?

Yes. Very well.

Close your eyes.

Concentrate.

Explore your past.

Do you have a memory?

Allow it to fill you up.

Lose yourself within it.

Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum.

Expecto Patronum.

Very good.

Shall we? Wand at the ready.

Expecto Patronum!

Expecto... Expecto...

Expect...

Here we go. Come on.

Sit up. Deep breaths.

It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.

That would have been remarkable.

Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

That's one nasty dementor.

Oh, no, no, no.

That was a boggart, Harry.

A boggart.

The real thing would be worse.

Much, much worse.

As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?

Which memory did you choose?

The first time I rode a broom.

That's not good enough.

Not nearly good enough.

There's another.

It's not happy, exactly.

Well, it is.

It's the happiest I've ever felt... but it's complicated.

Is it strong?

Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

Just do it.

Expecto Patronum!

Expecto Patronum!

Yes!

Well done, Harry. Well done!

I think I've had enough for today.

Yes. Sit down. Here.

Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

And just so you know, Harry... I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that... is saying something.

I was thinking of him.

And Mum.

Seeing their faces.

They were talking to me.

Just talking.

That's the memory I chose.

I don't even know if it's real.

But it's the best I have.

Beautiful day.

Gorgeous.

Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

Ripped to pieces?

What are you talking about?

Ronald has lost his rat.

I haven't lost anything!

Your cat killed him!

Rubbish.

Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about.

And Scabbers is gone.

Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!

Your cat killed him!

Did not.

Did.

Didn't.

How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

Well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there.

I got up and did my piece.

Said how Buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.

And then Lucius Malfoy got up.

Well, you can imagine.

He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you.

And then?

And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.

They're not sacking you!

No, I'm not sacked.

Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

Spiders! There's... There's spiders.

Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

I don't wanna tap-dance!

Tell those spiders.

Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

Peter Pettigrew?

Little lump of a boy.

Always trailing after Sirius Black.

Black was vicious.

He didn 't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!

Put that light out!

Sorry.

Watch it there, boy.

We're trying to sleep here!

Mischief managed. Nox.

Potter.

What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?

I was sleepwalking.

How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.

He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.

My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

If you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

Turn out your pockets.

Turn out your pockets!

What's this?

Spare bit of parchment.

Really? Open it.

Reveal your secrets.

Read it.

"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs... offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."

Go on.

"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."

You insolent little...

Professor!

Well, well. Lupin.

Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?

Harry, are you all right?

That remains to be seen.

I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.

Take a look, Lupin.

Supposed to be your area of expertise.

Clearly, it's full of dark magic.

I seriously doubt it, Severus.

It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it.

I suspect it's a Zonko product.

Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.

It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.

Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.

Are you deaf? Put that light out!

Come in.

I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.

Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black... is a map to you?

No.

No, sir.

Your father never set much store by the rules either.

But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.

Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!

Now, I will not cover up for you again.

Do you hear me?

Yes, sir.

I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.

And don't take any detours.

If you do, I shall know.

Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works.

Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.

Someone I know to be dead.

Oh, really? And who might that be?

Peter Pettigrew.

That's not possible.

It's just what I saw.

Good night, professor.

Broaden your minds.

You must look beyond.

The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

Only then can you see. Try again.

Now, what do we have here?

Do you mind me trying?

The Grim, possibly.

My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class... I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit... for the noble art of Divination.

No, you see, there.

You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled... as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books... to which you so desperately cleave.

Have I said something?

She's gone mental, Hermione has.

Not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see.

Hang on.

We better take this back.

I'm not going back.

Fine. See you later.

See you.

Harry Potter...

Professor Trelawney...

He will return tonight.

Sorry?

Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder... shall break free.

Innocent blood shall be spilt... and servant and master shall be reunited once more.

I'm so sorry, dear boy.

Did you say something?

No.

Nothing.

I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

It just got worse.

What did I say? Father said... I can keep the hippogriff's head.

I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

This is going to be rich.

Look who's here.

Come to see the show?

You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

Hermione, no!

He's not worth it.

Malfoy, are you okay?

Let's go. Quick.

Not a word to anyone, understood?

That felt good.

Not good, brilliant!

Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.

Why don't we just set him free?

They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore... would get into trouble.

He's coming down, Dumbledore.

Says he wants to be with me when they...

When it happens.

Great man, Dumbledore.

A great man.

We'll stay with you too.

You'll do no such thing!

Think I want you seeing something like that? No.

You just drink your tea and be off.

Oh. Before you do, Ron...

Scabbers! You're alive!

Keep a closer eye on your pet.

I think you owe someone an apology.

Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.

I meant me!

Blimey! What was that?

Ow!

Hagrid!

Oh, crikey.

No, minister. Over this way.

It's late. It's nearly dark.

You shouldn't be here.

Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

Particularly you, Harry.

With you in a moment!

Quick. Quick!

Hagrid.

It'll be fine. It'll be okay.

Go on, go on!

That's ling you see over there...

On the slope.

On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.

Professor Dumbledore.

Good evening.

Minister. Make your way through.

Have a tea, if you like.

No, Hagrid.

Gentlemen.

I'd like a cup of tea.

Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?

Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal... of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak... hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.

Dear, dear...

Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

All right. It'll be all right.

The execution shall dispatch...

What?

I thought I just saw...

Never mind.

Let's go!

Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

Oh, no.

He bit me! Scabbers!

Ron. Ron!

Ron!

Scabbers, come back!

Wait!

Scabbers, you bit me!

Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

That's not good. Ron, run!

Harry, Hermione, run!

It's the Grim!

Harry!

Ron! Ron, wait!

Harry!

Help!

Ron!

Ron! Ron!

Ron!

Come on!

Move!

Duck!

Harry!

Oh, I'm sorry.

Don't worry.

Where do you suppose this goes?

I have a hunch.

I just hope I'm wrong.

We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?

Come on.

Ron.

Ron. You're okay.

The dog. Where is it?

It's a trap. He's the dog.

He's an Animagus.

If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!

No. Only one will die tonight.

Then it'll be you!

Are you going to kill me, Harry?

Expelliarmus!

Well, well, Sirius.

Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.

Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?

I found him.

I know.

It's him.

I understand.

Let's kill him!

No! I trusted you!

And all this time, you've been his friend.

He's a werewolf!

That's why he's been missing classes.

How long have you known?

Since Professor Snape set the essay.

Well, Hermione.

You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.

Enough talk, Remus!

Come on, let's kill him!

Wait!

I did my waiting!

Twelve years of it!

In Azkaban!

Very well. Kill him.

But wait one more minute.

Harry has the right to know why.

I know why.

You betrayed my parents.

You're the reason they're dead!

No, it wasn't him.

Somebody did betray your parents... somebody who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead!

Who was it, then?

Peter Pettigrew!

And he's in this room! Right now!

Come out, come out, Peter!

Come out, come out and play!

Expelliarmus!

Vengeance is sweet.

How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

Severus...

I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

Brilliant, Snape.

You've put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.

If you'll excuse us, Remus and I have business... to attend to.

Give me a reason. I beg you!

Don't be a fool.

He can't help it. It's habit.

Be quiet.

Be quiet yourself!

You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.

Run along and play with your chemistry set!

I could do it, you know.

But why deny the dementors?

They're so longing to see you.

Do I detect a flicker of fear?

Oh, yes.

A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like.

It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.

Severus, please.

After you.

Expelliarmus!

Harry! What did you just do?

You attacked a teacher!

Tell me about Peter.

He was at school with us.

We thought he was our friend!

No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!

No, he didn't.

I thought so too, until you mentioned Pettigrew on the map!

The map was lying, then.

The map never lies!

Pettigrew's alive!

And he's right there!

Me?! He's mental!

Not you! Your rat!

Scabbers has been in my family for...

Twelve years?

Curiously long life for a common garden rat!

He's missing a toe, isn't he?

So what?

All they could find of Pettigrew was his...

Finger!

Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!

And then he transformed into a rat!

Show me.

Give it to him, Ron.

What are you trying to do to him?

Scabbers!

Leave him alone! Get off him!

What are you doing?

Remus?

Sirius.

My old friends!

Harry! Look at you!

You look so much like your father!

Like James! We were the best of friends...

How dare you speak to Harry!

How dare you talk about James in front of him!

You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you?

I didn't mean to!

The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!

Ask yourself, Sirius!

What would you have done?

What would you have done?

I would have died! I would have died, rather than betray my friends!

Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed!

Your dad... Your dad would have spared me!

He would shown me mercy!

Should've realized, Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! Together!

No!

Harry, this man...

I know what he is.

But we'll take him to the castle.

Bless you, boy! Bless you!

Get off!

I said we'd take you to the castle.

After that, the dementors can have you.

Sorry about the bite.

I reckon that twinges a bit.

A bit? A bit?

You almost tore my leg off!

I was going for the rat.

Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.

More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.

The tail I could live with.

But the fleas, they're murder.

Okay.

You better go.

No. Don't worry, okay?

It's fine. I'll stay.

You go, I'll stay.

You okay?

I'm fine. Go.

That looks really painful.

So painful.

They might chop it.

I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.

It's too late. It's ruined.

It'll have to be chopped off.

It's beautiful, isn't it?

I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.

It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.

That was a noble thing you did back there.

He doesn't deserve it.

I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends... to become killers.

Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.

Alive, you're free.

Turn me into a maggot!

Turn me into a flobberworm!

Anything but the dementors!

Ron! Haven't I been a good freind? A good pet?

You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you?

I was your rat!

Sweet girl! Clever girl! Surely you won't let them...

Get away from her!

I don't know if you know, Harry... but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.

I know.

I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home...

What? Come and live with you?

It's just a thought.

I can understand if you don't want to.

Harry!

Remus, my old friend!

Have you taken your potion tonight?

You know the man you truly are, Remus!

This heart is where you truly live! This heart here!

This flesh is only flesh!

Expelliarmus!

Harry!

Remus! Remus!

Run! Run!

Come on.

Wait! Wait!

Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

Professor?

Professor Lupin?

Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

There you are, Potter!

Sirius!

Come back here, Potter!

Sirius!

No. Sirius!

Expecto Patronum!

Harry?

I saw my dad.

What?

He sent the dementors away.

I saw him across the lake.

Harry, they've captured Sirius.

Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.

They're gonna kill him?

No. It's worse.

Much worse.

They're going to suck out his soul.

Headmaster, stop them.

They've got the wrong man.

It's true. Sirius is innocent.

It's Scabbers who did it.

Scabbers?

He's my rat, sir.

He's not really a rat. He was a rat.

He was my brother Percy's rat.

But then they gave him an owl...

The point is, we know the truth.

Please believe us.

I do, Miss Granger.

But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.

A child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.

Mysterious thing, time.

Powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous.

Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.

You know the laws, Miss Granger.

You must not be seen.

And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.

If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.

If you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared.

Three turns should do it, I think.

Oh, and by the way.

When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.

Good luck.

What the bloody hell was that all about?

Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...

What just happened?

Where's Ron?

7:30.

Where were we at 7:30?

I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

Come on. And we can't be seen.

Hermione!

Hermione! Hermione, wait.

Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?

You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!

That's us.

Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

This is not normal.

This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

McGonagall gave it to me first term.

This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.

You mean we've gone back in time?

Yes.

Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.

Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.

Good punch.

Thanks.

Malfoy's coming.

Run.

Not a word to anyone, understood?

I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.

That felt good.

Not good, brilliant.

Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

Of course.

Remember what Dumbledore said?

If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.

Let's go.

Here they come. I'd better hurry.

Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.

Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.

Scabbers, you're alive!

Keep a closer eye on your pet.

That's Pettigrew.

Harry, you can't.

He betrayed my parents.

You don't expect me to sit here.

Yes, and you must!

Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.

Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.

We can't be seen.

Fudge is coming.

And we aren't leaving?

Why aren't we leaving?

Are you mad?

Ow!

Ow! That hurt!

Sorry.

We're coming out the back door. Go!

Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?

What?

I thought I just saw...

Never mind.

Let's go.

Okay, go, Harry. Go!

Get away. Get off.

Minister, I really think I should sign as well.

Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.

Come with us now. Come on.

Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

Buckbeak. Okay?

Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

Your name only.

It's such a very long name...

Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

Come on.

Come on, Buckbeak.

Come and get the nice dead ferret.

Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.

Here we are, minister. Follow me.

Now, look there.

Where?

Look beyond the rocks.

What am I supposed to see?

Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.

Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.

And all the strawberries.

Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.

I see no strawberries.

Over there.

Where?

Over there.

This way.

Let's get this over, please.

All right.

But where is it?

I saw the beast, just now.

Not a moment ago!

How extraordinary.

Buckbeak.

Come now, Dumbledore.

Someone's obviously released him.

Hagrid?

Buckbeak.

I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.

How could you?

You've been with us all the time.

Right.

Well, well.

We must search the grounds.

Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.

Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.

Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.

Thank you.

You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.

Come on.

This way.

This way, now.

Now what?

We save Sirius.

How?

No idea.

Look. It's Lupin.

Immobulus!

And Snape's coming.

And now we wait.

And now we wait.

At least someone's enjoying himself.

Yeah.

Hermione?

Yeah?

Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius... I did see someone.

That someone made the dementors go away.

With a Patronus.

I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

According to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.

It was my dad.

My dad conjured the Patronus.

Harry, but your dad's...

Dead. I know.

I'm just telling you what I saw.

Here we come.

You see Sirius talking to me there?

He's asking me to come live with him.

That's great.

When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.

It'll just be me and him.

We could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky.

He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.

Harry!

Run!

Let's go!

What are you doing?

Saving your life!

Thanks.

Great! Now he's coming for us.

Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

That was so scary.

Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.

Sirius! Come on!

This is horrible.

Don't worry.

My dad will come.

He'll conjure the Patronus.

Any minute now!

Right there! You'll see!

Harry, listen to me.

No one's coming.

Don't worry, he will!

He will come!

Sirius.

You're dying... both of you.

Harry!

Expecto Patronum!

You were right, Hermione.

It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.

It was me!

I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.

I knew I could do it this time because... well, I had already done it.

Does that make sense?

No.

But I don't like flying...!

Bombarda!

I'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you.

I want to go with you.

One day, perhaps.

For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.

And besides... you're meant to be here.

But you're innocent.

And you know it.

And for now, that will do.

I expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father.

Except your eyes.

You have...

My mother's eyes.

It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.

But know this: The ones that love us never really leave us.

And you can always find them... in here.

You really are the brightest witch of your age.

We have to go.

Well?

He's free. We did it.

Did what?

Good night.

How did you get there?

I was talking to you there.

And now you're there.

What's he talking about, Harry?

I don't know.

Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?

Hello, Harry.

I saw you coming.

I've looked worse, believe me.

You've been sacked.

No.

No. I resigned, actually.

Resigned? Why?

Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.

This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children.

But Dumbledore...

He has already... risked enough on my behalf.

Besides, people like me are...

Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.

Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

None of it made any difference.

Pettigrew escaped.

Didn't make any difference?

It made all the difference in the world.

You uncovered the truth.

You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.

It made a great deal of difference.

If I am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year.

Now, since I am no longer your teacher... I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.

So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

Until then... mischief managed.

Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.

Harry.

Wherever did you get it?

Can I have a go, Harry?

After you, of course.

What are you talking about?

Quiet.

Let the man through.

I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

It was badly wrapped.

They made me do it.

Did not.

It's a Firebolt.

It's the fastest broom in the world.

For me?

But who sent it?

No one knows.

This came with it.

Go on, Harry!

Yeah, let's see.

How fast is it, Harry?

Lumos.

I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.

Mischief managed.

Nox.

An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food.
He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what
he's doing and walks to the door.

OLD MAN
Bloody kids.

He leaves the house and heads towards the light.


EXT. DARKNESS

The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.
He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing
the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs.
The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is
taking place and listens on.

WORMTAIL
Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only
meant... perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy..


VOLDEMORT
NO! The boy is everything, it cannot
be done without him and it WILL be done
exactly as I say.

UNKNOWN MAN
I will not disappoint you my lord.


VOLDEMORT
Good. First, gather our old comrades.
Send them a sign.

A snake slithers past the old man and into the room.

VOLDEMORT
Nagini tells me the old caretaker is
standing outside the door.

Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The
old man looks terrified.

VOLDEMORT
Step aside so I can give our guest a
proper greeting.

A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic.



INT. BEDROOM

HERMIONE
Harry!

Harry is flustered and still panicing.

HERMIONE
Are you alright?

HARRY
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get
here?

HERMIONE
Just now. You?

HARRY
Last night.

Hermione goes over to Ron's bed.

HERMIONE
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!

RON
Bloody hell.

HERMIONE
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go
back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother
says breakfast's ready.


EXT. GRASSLAND

HARRY
Where are we actually going?

RON
Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?


ARTHUR
Haven't the foggiest, keep up!

AMOS
Arthur! It's about time son.

ARTHUR
Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of
a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory
everyone, he works with me at the ministry.
And this strapping young lad must be
Cedric, am I right?

CEDRIC
Yes sir.

AMOS
Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.


HARRY
Yes sir. This way.

AMOS
Great great pleasure.

They shake hands.

HARRY
Pleasure to meet you too sir.

They walk on up the hill.

ARTHUR
That's it sir, just over there.

AMOS
Shall we? We don't want to be late.


Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.

HARRY
Why are they all standing around that
manky old boot?

FRED
That isn't just any old manky boot mate.


GEORGE
It's a portkey.

Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot.

AMOS
Time to go. Ready?

HARRY
What's a 'portkey'?

AMOS
After 3. One... Two...

ARTHUR
Harry!

Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot.

AMOS
Three!

There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through
the air. Everyone cheers.

ARTHUR
Let go kids!

HERMIONE
What??

ARTHUR
Let! Go!

Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with
a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.


ARTHUR
I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?


Cedric helps Harry to his feet.

HARRY
Thanks.

They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd
gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.

ARTHUR
Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch
World Cup!

They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing
and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small
tent.

AMOS
Parting of the waves I think old chap,
see you at the match.

Amos and Cedric separate and walk off.

HARRY
See ya later Cedric.

ARTHUR
Home sweet home.


INT. TENT

They enter the tent, the inside is many times bigger than the
outside.

ARTHUR
Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron,
get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.


TWINS
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.

ARTHUR
Feet off the table.

TWINS
Feet off the table.

They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon
as Arthur has walked past.

HARRY
(Smiling) I love magic.


EXT. HILLSIDE

We pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have
a huge number of floors.

INT. STADIUM

The Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats.

RON
Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?

Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them.

LUCIUS
Well put it this way, if it rains...
you'll be the first to know

DRACO
Father and I are in the minister's box,
by personal invitation of Cornelius
Fudge himself.

LUCIUS
Don't boast Draco. There's no need with
these people. Do enjoy yourself won't
you. While you can.

The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off.

ARTHUR
Come on up, take your seats. I told
you these seats would be worth waiting
for.

GEORGE
Come on!

FRED
It's the Irish!

Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms
leaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun
appears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited.


GEORGE
Here come the Bulgarians!

Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his
broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins
to chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'.

WEASLEYS
Krum!!!

GEORGE
Yes!

Viktor Krum waves to the crowd.

ANNOUNCER
Good evening! It gives me great pleasure
to welcome each and every one of you
to the final of the 422nd Quidditch
World Cup. Let the match begin!


INT. TENT

RON
There's no one like Krum. He's like
a bird the way he rides the wind. He's
more than an athlete, he's an artist.


The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'.


GINNY
Think you're in love Ron?

TWINS
(Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor
I do!

Harry joins in.

BOYS
When we're apart my heart beats only
for youuu!

FRED
Sounds like the irish have got their
pride on.

ARTHUR
Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've
gotta get out of here. Now.


EXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT

ARTHUR
Get back to the portkey everybody, and
stick together. Fred, George... Ginny
is your responsibility.

Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking
across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced
and rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious.


EXT. OUTSIDE - TIME PASSED

The crowds have all gone. A man walks through the rubble kicking
at things. He casts a spell which causes a bright flash and a
large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from
it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented. Harry stirs and witnesses
the man standing there. Harry runs. The familiar voices of Ron
and Hermione are calling for him.

RON
Been looking for you for ages. Thought
we lost you.

HARRY
What is THAT?

They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry holds his
head in pain. Suddenly they are fired on.

ARTHUR
Stop! That's my son.

Arthur and others approach.

ARTHUR
Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?


BARTY
Which of you conjured this?

ARTHUR
You can't possibly..

BARTY
Do not lie! You have been discovered
at the scene of the crime!

HARRY
Crime?

ARTHUR
Barty, they're just kids.

HARRY
What crime?

HERMIONE
Harry it's his mark.

HARRY
Those people tonight, in the masks...
they're his too aren't they? they're
his followers.

BARTY
Follow me.

HARRY
There was a man. Before. There.

BARTY
All of you, this way.

ARTHUR
Harry, who?

HARRY
I dunno. I didn't see his face.


INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE

Harry, Ron and Hermione are seated on a train. A voice calls
out.

LADY OFFSCREEN
Anything from the trolley? Anything
from the trolley?

The lady appears at their door.

LADY
Anything from the trolley dears?

RON
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.


Ron sees he hasn't enough money.

RON
On second thought, just the drewbals.


HARRY
It's alright I'll get it.

RON
Just the drewbals, thanks.

Cho Chan walks up to the trolley.

CHO
Two pumpkin pasties please.

Harry and Cho look at each other and smile.

CHO
Thank you.

LADY
Anything sweet for you dear?

HARRY
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.

HERMIONE
This is horrible, how can the ministry
not know who conjured it. Isn't there
any security or?

RON
Loads according to Dad, that's what
worried them so much. Happened right
under their noses.

Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head.

HERMIONE
It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.


HARRY
I'm fine.

HERMIONE
You know Sirius will want to hear about
this. What you saw at the world cup,
and the dream.

Harry has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope
and gives it to an owl.


EXT. HOGWARTS

We see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage
coming in to land at Hogwarts. The crowds cheer.

HAGRID
Clear the runway.

HARRY
Well there's something you don't see
every day.

A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too.


DUMBLEDORE
Now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement. This
castle will not only be your home this
year but home to some very special guests
as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...


A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers
something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion.

DUMBLEDORE
So Hogwarts has been choosen to host
a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament.
Now for those of you who do not know,
the tri-wizard tournament brings together
three schools for a series of magical
contests. From each school a single
contestant is selected to compete. Now
let me be clear, if choosen you stand
alone. And trust me when I say these
contests are not for the faint hearted,
but more of that later. For now please
join me in welcoming the lovely ladies
of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic
and their headmistress Madam Maxime.


A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release
butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds.

STUDENT
Blimey, that's one big woman.

DUMBLEDORE
And now our friends from the north,
please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang
and the high master Igor Karkaroff.


A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs,
twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the
ground with a spark effect.

RON
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!

The boys breathe some fire.

IGOR
Albus!

DUMBLEDORE
Igor.

They embrace.


EXT. HOGWARTS - STORMY - NIGHT

MADAME MAXIME
Professor Dumbledore, my horses have
travelled a long way. They will need
attending to.

DUMBLEDORE
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper
Hagrid's more than capable of seeing
to them.

MADAME MAXIME
But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink
only single malt whiskey.

The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork
into his hand.

MAN
You idiot!


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
Your attention please! I would like
to say a few words. Eternal glory, that
is what awaits the student who wins
the tri-wizard tournament. But to do
this that student must survive three
tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.


FRED
Wicked.

DUMBLEDORE
For this reason the ministry has seen
fit to impose a new rule. To explain
all this we have the head of the department
of international magic cooperation Mister
Bartimus Crouch.

Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof
and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he
casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.


RON
Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.

HERMIONE
Alastor Moody? The aura.

RON
He was a catcher. Half the cells in
Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's
supposed to be mad as a hatter though
these days.

This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry
through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he
goes.

DUMBLEDORE
My dear old friend, thanks for coming.


MAD-EYE
That stupid roof.

Mad-Eye takes a drink.

PUPIL
What's that he's drinking do you suppose?


HARRY
I don't know but I don't think it's
Pumpkin Juice.

BARTY
After much deliberation the ministry
has concluded that for their own safety
no student under the age of seventeen
shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the tri-wizard tournament.
This decision is final.

The crowd is unsettled, people are booing.

GEORGE
That's rubbish! You don't know what
you're doing!

DUMBLEDORE
Silence!

Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing
a blue flame.

DUMBLEDORE
The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to
submit themselves for the tournament
merely write their name upon a piece
of parchment and throw it in the flame
before this hour on Thursday night.
Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's
no turning back. As from this moment
the tri-wizard tournament has begun.



INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

We see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet
is still burning and close the door behind him.


INT. CLASSROOM

MAD-EYE
Alastor Moody.

He writes his name on the board.

MAD-EYE
Ministry malcontent. And your new defence
against the dark arts teacher. I'm here
because Dumbledore asked me, end of
story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?
When it comes to the dark arts, I believe
in a practical approach. But first,
which of you can tell me how many unforgivable
curses there are?

HERMIONE
Three sir.

MAD-EYE
And they are so named?

HERMIONE
Because they are unforgivable. Use of
any one of them will...

MAD-EYE
Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban.
Correct. Now the ministry says you're
too young to see what these curses do.
I say different! You need to know what
you're up against, you need to be prepared,
you need to find somewhere else to put
your chewing gum other than the underside
of your desk Mr Finnigan!

PUPIL
Aw no way, the old codger can see out
the back of his head.

Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger.

MAD-EYE
So, which curse shall we see first?
WEASLEY!

RON
Yes...

MAD-EYE
Give us a curse.

RON
Well, my dad did tell me about one...
The imperious curse.

MAD-EYE
Ahhh yes, your father would know all
about that. Gave the ministry quite
a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps
this will show you why.

Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.

MAD-EYE
Hello. What a little beauty.

He uses his wand to send it around the class.

MAD-EYE
Don't worry. Completely harmless.

The class is unsettled.

MAD-EYE
But if she bites... she's lethal!

Draco laughs.

MAD-EYE
What are you laughing at?

Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face.

MAD-EYE
Talented isn't she? What shall I have
her do next? Jump out the window? Drown
herself?

Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling.


MAD-EYE
Scores of witches and wizards have claimed
that they only do did you-know-whose
bidding under the influence of the imperious
curse. But here's the rub, how do we
sort out the liars? Another.. another..
Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.


Neville Longbottom stands.

MAD-EYE
Professor Sprout tells me you have an
aptitude for herbology.

NEVILLE
There's the um... The cruciatus curse.


MAD-EYE
Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly
nasty. The torture curse.

Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.


HERMIONE
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering
him, stop it!

Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider
which is still making a noise.

MAD-EYE
Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable
curse Miss Granger.

Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.


MAD-EYE
The killing curse. Only one person is
known to have survived it. And he's
sitting in this room.

He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink.


INT. STAIRS

RON
Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented
of course. Terrifying to be in the same
room with, he's really BEEN there you
know.

HERMIONE
There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,
and to perform them in a classroom.
I mean did you see Neville's face.


They see a boy on the stairs facing the window.

HERMIONE
Neville?

Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder.

MAD-EYE
Son. You alright?

Neville nods.

MAD-EYE
Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I
want to show you something.


INT. GOBLET ROOM

Older students are placing their names into the flame and others
are applauding, Cedric is one of them.

RON
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't
it? In three years from now we'll be
old enough to be choosen.

HARRY
Yeah well rather you than me.

The twins come up cheering.

GEORGE
Thank you thank you, well lads we've
done it.

FRED
Cooked it up just this morning.

HERMIONE
It's not going to work.

FRED
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.

HERMIONE
You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore
drew it himself.

FRED
So?

HERMIONE
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't
possibly be fooled by something pathetically
dimwitted such as an age potion.

GEORGE
That's why it's so brilliant.

GEORGE
Ready Fred?

FRED
Ready George?

They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names
in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're
flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have
full heads of grey hair and beards.

GEORGE
You said..

Fred You said..

They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The
room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts
his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles.



INT. GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT

DUMBLEDORE
Sit down please. And now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the champions
selection!

Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name
comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously.

DUMBLEDORE
The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor
Krum!

The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out.

DUMBLEDORE
The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur
Delacour

The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes
out.

DUMBLEDORE
The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.


Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage.

DUMBLEDORE
Excellent! we now have our three champions!
But in the end only one will go down
in history. Only one will hoist this
chalice of champions, this vessel of
victory the tri-wizard cup!

People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another
name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads...

DUMBLEDORE
Harry Potter. Harry Potter?

HAGRID
No... No.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry Potter!

HERMIONE
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.


Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Voices
in the crowd shout out.

VOICE
He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen
yet.


INT. ROOM

Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts
in and grabs Harry.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Did you put your name in the
goblet of fire?

HARRY
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE
Did you ask one of the older students
to do it for you?

HARRY
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE
You're absolutely sure?

HARRY
Yes sir.

MADAME MAXIME
Well of course he is lying.

MAD-EYE
The hell he is. The goblet of fire is
an exceptionally powerful magical object,
only an exceptionally powerful conjurer
could have hoodwinked it. Magic way
beyond the talents of a fourth year.


IGOR
You seem to have given this a fair bit
of thought Mad-Eye.

MAD-EYE
It was once my job to think as dark
wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?


DUMBLEDORE
That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this
to you Barty.

BARTY
The rules are absolute, the goblet of
fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of
tonight... a tri-wizards champion.



INT. DARKENED TOWER ROOM

MCGONAGALL
This can't go on Albus. First the dark
mark, now this?

DUMBLEDORE
What do you suggest Minerva?

MCGONAGALL
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.


DUMBLEDORE
You heard Barty the rules are clear.


MCGONAGALL
Well the devil with Barty and his rules.
And since when did you accomodate them...


SEVERUS
Master I too find it difficult to believe
this mere coincidence, if we are to
truly discover the meaning of these
events perhaps we should for the time
being let them unfold.

MCGONAGALL
Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter
is a boy not a piece of meat.

DUMBLEDORE
I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep
an eye on Harry will you?

MAD-EYE
I can do that.

DUMBLEDORE
Don't let him know though, he must be
anxious enough as it is... knowing what
lies ahead. Then again, we all are.



INT. BEDROOM

RON
How did you do it?

Harry is silent.

RON
Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could
have let your best friend know though.


HARRY
Let you know what?

RON
You know bloody well what.

HARRY
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron.
Okay? You're being stupid.

RON
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry
Potter's stupid friend.

HARRY
I didn't put my name in that cup. I
don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna
be.. Look, I don't know what happened
tonight and I don't know why, it just
did ok.

RON
Piss off.


INT. HOGWARTS

A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed
colorfully.

RITA
What a charismatic quartet. Hello!


The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group.
She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands.

RITA
I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily
prophet. But of course you know that
don't you. It's you we don't know, you're
the news. What quirks lurk beneath those
rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles
mask? does courage lie beneath those
curls? In short, what makes a champion
tick. Me, myself and I want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers. So,
who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall
we start with the youngest. Lovely.


She takes Harry by the hand into a closet.

RITA
This is cosy.

HARRY
It's a broomcupboard.

RITA
You should feel right at home then.
Don't mind if I use the quill do you?


HARRY
Oh, no.

RITA
So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of
twelve..

HARRY
I'm fourteen.

RITA
...about to compete against three students.
Not only vastly more emotionally mature
than yourself but have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest
daydreams. Concerned?

HARRY
I dunno I haven't really thought about
it.

RITA
Course you're not just any ordinary
boy of twelve are you...

HARRY
Fourteen.

RITA
The story's legend. Do you think it
was the trauma of your past that made
you so keen to enter such a dangerous
tournament.

HARRY
No I didn't enter.

RITA
Course you didn't. Everyone loves a
rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch
that last. Speaking of your parents,
were they alive, how do you think they'd
feel? proud? or concerned that your
attitude shows at best a pathological
need for attention, at worst a psychotic
deathwish.

HARRY
(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes
aren't glistening with the ghosts of
my past.


INT. ROOFTOP

An owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins
to read.

SIR
(VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending
Edward. It was since the world cup and
the ministry's been intercepting more
and more owls and she's too easily recognised.
We need to talk Harry. Face to face.
Meet me in the Griffindore common room
at one o clock this Saturday night and
make sure you're alone. P.S....

The owl nips Harry's finger.

HARRY
AGH!

SIR
(VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites.



INT. GRIFFINDORE COMMON ROOM

HARRY
Sirius?

Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads "THE CHAMPIONS
ARE SELECTED" and reads.

RITA
(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 12, suspect
entrant in the tri-wizard tournament.
His eyes swimming with the ghosts of
his...

Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and
puts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears
in it.

HARRY
Sirius?! How...

SIR
I don't have much time Harry so let
me get straight to it. Did you or did
you not put your name into the goblet
of fire?

HARRY
No!

SIR
Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about
this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail
and Voldemort, but who was the third
man in the room?

HARRY
I dunno.

SIR
You didn't hear a name?

HARRY
No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a
job to do. Something important.

SIR
What was that?

HARRY
He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he
was gonna use this man to get to me.
I mean it was only a dream right?


SIR
Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry,
the deatheaters at the world cup, your
name rising from that goblet these are
not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't
safe any more.

HARRY
What are you saying?

SIR
I'm saying the devils are inside the
walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater.
And no one, no one stops being a deatheater.
Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of
stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.


HARRY
Do you think one of them put my name
in the goblet?

SIR
I haven't a clue who put your name in
that goblet Harry but whoever did it
is no friend to you. People die in this
tournament.

HARRY
I'm not ready for this Sirius.

SIR
You don't have a choice.

HARRY
Someone's coming!

SIR
Keep your friends close Harry.

Ron enters the room.

RON
Who you talking to?

HARRY
Who says I was talking to anyone.

RON
I heard voices.

HARRY
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't
be the first time.

RON
You're probably just practicing for
your next interview I expect.

Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone.
The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".



EXT. LAKESIDE

NEVILLE
Amazing. Amazing.

HARRY
Neville! You're doing it again!

NEVILLE
Oh, right sorry.

HARRY
(reading a book) Magical water plants
of the highland Lochs?

NEVILLE
Moody gave it to me. That day we had
tea.

Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them.

HERMIONE
(Whispering to Ron) We've already been
through enough people why don't you
just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What
do you want me to say again?

Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry
are not on speaking terms.

Hermione walks up to Harry.

HERMIONE
Ronald would like me to tell you that
Seamus told him that Dean was told by
Parvati that Hagrid was looking for
you.

HARRY
Is that right? Well.... what?

HERMIONE
Uhhh...

She walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back.

HERMIONE
Dean was told by Parvati that... Please
don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's
looking for you.

HARRY
Well you can tell Ronald...

HERMIONE
I'm NOT an owl!


INT. FOREST

Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest.

HAGRID
Did you bring your father's cloak like
I asked you?

HARRY
Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where
are we going?

HAGRID
You'll see soon enough. Pay attention
this is important.

HARRY
What's with the flower? Hagrid have
you combed your hair?

Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big
red flower.

HAGRID
As a matter of fact I have. You might
like to try the same thing now and again.


We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid.

MADAME MAXIME
Hagrid?

HAGRID
Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.

Harry does as he's told.

HAGRID
Bonsoir Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME
Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming,
I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten
me.

HAGRID
Couldn't forget you Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME
What is it you want to show me? When
we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.


HAGRID
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.


A dragon nearby gives a loud roar.

MADAME MAXIME
Ahh, c'est magnifique!

In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring
and breathing fire.

MADAME MAXIME
Can we get closer?

HARRY
Dragons? That's the first task? You're
joking.

HAGRID
Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood
creatures.

A huge flame fires up.

HAGRID
Although, I have to admit that horntail
is a right nasty piece of work. Poor
Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you
know.

HARRY
Ron was here?

HAGRID
Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped
bring him over from Romania. Didn't
Ron tell you that?

HARRY
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.



EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME

We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow
background. Then the badge spins and shows Harry on a green background
with the words "Potter Stinks" on it. As Harry walks along other
pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs
past.

BOY
Cedric rules!

HARRY
Thanks.

Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way.

BOY
Like the badge?

HARRY
Excuse me..

They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric
who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl
off more insults.

HARRY
(to Cedric) Can I have a word?

CEDRIC
Alright.

They walk away some distance.

HARRY
Dragons. That's the first task. They've
got one for each of us.

CEDRIC
Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum,
do they...?

HARRY
Yes.

CEDRIC
Right. Hey listen, about the badges.
I've asked them not to wear them.


HARRY
Don't worry about it.

Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them.

HARRY
(To Ron) You're a right foul git you
know that?

RON
You think so?

HARRY
I know so.

RON
Anything else?

HARRY
Yeah. Stay away from me.

RON
Fine.


Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree.

DRACO
Why so tense Potter? My father and I
have a bet you see. I don't think you're
gonna last ten minutes in this tournament.
He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
FIVE.

HARRY
I don't give a damn what you or your
father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and
cruel, and you're just pathetic.

Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye
appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.

MAD-EYE
I'll teach you to cast when someone's
back is turned.

MCGONAGALL
Professor Moody what are you doing?


MAD-EYE
Teaching.

MCGONAGALL
Is that a student?

MAD-EYE
Technically it's a ferret.

Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the
trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable.
Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs.
Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back
to normal.

DRACO
My father will hear about this!

MAD-EYE
Is that a threat!

Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.

MAD-EYE
I could tell you stories about your
father that would curl even your greasy
hair boy! It doesn't end here!

MCGONAGALL
We never use transfigration as a punishment,
surely Dumbledore told you that.

MAD-EYE
He might've mentioned it.

MCGONAGALL
Well you will do well to remember it.


MAD-EYE
(To Harry) come with me.


INT. MAD-EYE'S ROOM

Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.

MAD-EYE
That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an
eye on my enemies. If I can see the
whites of their eyes they're standing
right behind me.

A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes.

MAD-EYE
Wouldn't even bother telling you what's
in ther. You wouldn't believe it if
I did. Now... what are you going to
do about your dragon?

HARRY
Oh... um... You know I just thought
I'd...

MAD-EYE
Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory,
by your age he could take a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the
time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a
fairy princess as I am. As for Krum,
his head may be filled with sawdust
but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have
a strategy, and you can bet that it'll
play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come
on Potter. What are your strengths?


HARRY
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm
a fair flyer.

MAD-EYE
Better than fair the way I heard it.


HARRY
But I'm not allowed a broom.

MAD-EYE
You're allowed a wand.


EXT. ARENA - TOURNAMENT STAGE 1

The crowds are cheering, people are taking bets.


INT. WAITING TENT

Harry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door
whispering in.

HERMIONE
Pssst! Harry? Is that you?

HARRY
Yeah.

HERMIONE
How are you feeling? OK? The key is
to concentrate. After that you just
have to...

HARRY
Battle a dragon.

Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes,
Rita Skeeter the journalist approaches.

RITA
Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything
goes unfortunately today you might make
the front page.

VIKTOR
(To Rita) You have no business here.
This tent is for champions and friends.


RITA
No matter. We've got what we wanted.


Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters.

DUMBLEDORE
Good day champions. Gather round please.
Now you've waited, you've wondered and
at last the moment has arrived. The
moment only four of you can fully appreciate.


The champions gather around him in a circle.

DUMBLEDORE
What are you doing here Miss Granger?


HERMIONE
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.

DUMBLEDORE
Barty. The bag.

BARTY
Champions, in a circle around me. Miss
Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter
over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if
you will...

Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon.


BARTY
The welsh green. Mr Krum...

Viktor takes another out

BARTY
The chinese fireball. Oooooh.

Cedric picks one.

BARTY
The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...


HARRY
The horntail...

BARTY
What's that boy?

HARRY
Nothing.

Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon.

BARTY
The hungarian horntail. These represent
very real dragons, each of which has
been given a golden egg to protect.
Your objective is simple, collect the
egg. This you must do, for each egg
contains a clue without which you cannot
hope to proceed to the next task. Any
questions?

DUMBLEDORE
Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory
the sound of the cannon...

The cannon fires immediately.

Transcribed by IMSDb.com


INT. TENT

Harry is sitting alone nervously.

DUMBLEDORE
(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of
our champions have now faced their dragons
and so each one of them will proceed
to the next task. And now our fourth
and final contestant.

Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name.
He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but
the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as
the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena.


HERMIONE
Your wand harry! Your wand!

Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon
gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look
stunned.


EXT. HOGWARTS SKY

Harry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings.
The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands
on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon
is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry
reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets
go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him.
He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area
with a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon
crashes into it and falls into the water.


INT. ARENA

The crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us
and the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg.



INT. HOGWARTS

Harry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering.
The Weasly twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders.

GEORGE
We knew you wouldn't die Harry.

FRED
Lose a leg.

GEORGE
Or an arm.

FRED
Pack it in altogether.

TWINS
NEVER!

SEAMUS
Go on Harry, what's the clue?

Seamus hands Harry the golden egg.

HARRY
Who wants me to open it? You want me
to open it?

He opens the egg and a loud horrific screech comes out, he closes
it again.

HARRY
What the bloody hell was that?

Ron appears in the doorway.

FRED
Alright everyone, go back to your knitting.
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosey sods listening
in.

RON
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the goblet of
fire.

HARRY
Caught on have you. Took you long enough.


RON
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done
it. Everyone was saying it behind your
back.

HARRY
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads
better.

RON
At least I warned you about the dragons.


HARRY
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.


RON
Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus
told me that Parvati told Dean that
Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never
actually told me anything, so it was
really me all along. I thought you'd
be alright, you know, after you figured
that out.

HARRY
Who could possibly figure that out?
That's completely mental.

RON
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a
bit distraught.

HERMIONE
Boys.


INT. CLASSROOM

Harry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink
from his mouth. They laugh at him.

HERMIONE
(Reading a newspaper) Look at this!
I can't believe it she's done it again.
Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl
seems to be developing a taste for famous
wizards. Her latest prey sources report
is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon
Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry
Potter's taking this latest emotional
blow.

A young boy walks up holding a package.

NIGEL
Parcel for you Mr Weasley.

RON
Thank you Nigel.

Nigel is gazing at Harry.

RON
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.

Nigel leaves.

RON
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum
sent me a dress??

HARRY
Well it does match your eyes. Is there
a bonnet?

RON
Ginny these must be for you.

GINNY
I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.


Hermione laughs.

RON
What are you on about?

HERMIONE
They're not for Ginny they're for you!
Dress robes.

RON
Dress robes? for what?


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

MCGONAGALL
The yule ball has been a tradition of
the tri-wizard tournament since its
inception. On Christmas eve night we
and our guests gather in the great hall
for well mannered frivolity. As representitives
of the host school I expect each and
every one of you to put your best foot
forward, and I mean this literally because
the yule ball is first and foremost...
a dance.

Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem
a lot more excited.

MCGONAGALL
Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore
has commanded the respect of the wizard
world for nearly ten centuries. I will
not have you in the course of a single
evening besmirching that name by behaving
like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.


FRED
(Whispering to George) Try saying that
five times faster.

They try.

MCGONAGALL
(Continued) Now to dance is to let the
body breathe, inside every girl a secret
swan slumbers longing to burst forth
and take flight.

RON
(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about
to burst out of Hilary but I don't think
it's a swan.

MCGONAGALL
Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared
to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join
me.

She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance.

MCGONAGALL
Now, place your right hand on my waist.


RON
Where?

MCGONAGALL
My waist.

He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd.

MCGONAGALL
Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...

The music starts.

MCGONAGALL
One two three, one two three, one two
three.

HARRY
(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna
let him forget this are you?

TWINS
Never.

MCGONAGALL
Everybody come together.

The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all
still seated.

MCGONAGALL
Boys, on your feet.

Neville stands.


EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME

HARRY
Why do they always have to travel in
packs? How are you supposed to get one
alone to ask them...

RON
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If
you can't get a date who can?

HARRY
I think I'd take the dragon right now.


Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs.



INT. HOGWARTS

Hagrid and Madame Maxime are walking together.

HAGRID
I take after my mum. Though I didn't
know her very well, she left when I
was about three. No, not the maternal
sort her, broke my dad's heart though.
You know he was a tiny little fellow
my dad, I could pick him up with one
hand by the age of six and put him up
in the dresser.

They laugh together and have a moment.

HAGRID
And then he died when I was still in
school. So I had to make me own way
as it were. But enough of me, what about
you!


EXT. LAKESIDE

Viktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around.



INT. CLASSROOM

RON
This is mad. At this rate we'll be the
only ones in our year without dates.


Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head.

RON
Well, us and Neville!

HARRY
But then again he can take himself.


HERMIONE
It might interest you to know that Neville's
already got someone.

Ron gasps.

RON
Now I'm really depressed.

Fred hands Ron a note, it reads "GET A MOVE ON OR ALL THE GOOD
ONES WILL HAVE GONE!".

RON
Well Hermione, you're a girl.

HERMIONE
Oh well spotted.

RON
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone. For a girl it's just
sad.

HERMIONE
I won't be going alone because believe
it or not someone's asked me. And I
said yes.

RON
Bloody hell.

Hermione storms off.

RON
Look. We've just got to grit our teeth
and do it. Tonight when we get back
to the common room, we'll both have
partners. Agreed?

HARRY
Agreed.


EXT. HOGWARTS - SNOWY

Harry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps
into Cho who has come around the corner.

CHO
Harry!

HARRY
Cho!

CHO
Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a
bit icey at the top.

HARRY
Ok thanks. Cho?

CHO
Yes?

HARRY
Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me?


CHO
Sorry? I didn't catch that.

HARRY
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you
wanted to go to the ball with me.


CHO
Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's
already asked me. And well I've said
I'll go with him.

HARRY
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.


CHO
Harry I really am sorry.


INT. COMMON ROOM

Ron is being helped into the room, he looks shaky.

HARRY
What happened to you?

GIRL
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

HERMIONE
What?

HARRY
What did she say?

HERMIONE
No of course.

Ron shakes his head.

HERMIONE
She said yes??

HARRY
Don't be silly.

RON
There she was walking by. You know I
like it when they walk. I couldn't help
it, it just sort of slipped out.

GIRL
Actually he sort of screamed at her,
it was a bit frightening.

HARRY
What did you do then?

RON
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut
out for this Harry. I don't know what
got into me.

The Patil twins walk past.

PATILS
Hi Harry.

HARRY
Hey!


INT. DANCEHALL

Soft music plays and everyone is well dressed, gathered in the
hall.


ELSEWHERE

Ron is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced
and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes.

RON
Bloody hell.

Harry walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit.

RON
What are those??

HARRY
My dress robes.

RON
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy
little collar.

HARRY
Well I expect yours are more traditional.


RON
Traditional?? They're ancient! I look
like my great aunt Tessie.

He sniffs at his clothes.

RON
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder
me Harry.


INT. DANCEHALL

Harry and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron
is fidgeting with his outfit.

HARRY
Leave it alone.

RON
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room
crying her eyes out.

HARRY
Who?

RON
Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd
you think she wouldn't tell us who she's
coming with?

HARRY
Because we'd take the mickey out of
her if she did.

RON
Because nobody asked her. I would have
taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding
proud.

The boys approach the Patil twins.

PARVATI
Hello boys. Don't you look...

She looks at Ron.

PARVATI
... dashing.

MCGONAGALL
Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss
Patil ready?

HARRY
Ready professor?

MCGONAGALL
To dance. It's traditional that the
three champions or in this case four
are the first to dance. Surely I told
you that.

HARRY
No.

MCGONAGALL
Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your
Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great
hall with Miss Patil.

Hermione enters the room all dressed up.

PARVATI
She looks beautiful.

HARRY
Yeah she does.

Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and
they walk together.

PADMA
(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With
Viktor Krum??

RON
No. Absolutely not.

Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with
their partners.

PARVATI
Harry. Take my waist.

HARRY
What?

PARVATI
Now.

They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall,
Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits
on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now
rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from
Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates
are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes
up after a great time with Viktor.

HERMIONE
Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks.
Care to join us?

RON
No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.


HERMIONE
What's got your wand in a knot?

RON
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising
with the enemy.

HERMIONE
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?
Besides, the whole point of the tournament
is international magical cooperation,
to make friends.

RON
Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than
friendship on his mind.

Hermione walks off.

PADMA
Are you going to ask me to dance or
not?

RON
No.


LATER

RON
(To Hermione) He's using you.

HERMIONE
How dare you! Besides I can take care
of myself.

RON
Doubt it. He's way too old.

HERMIONE
What? What? That's what you think?


RON
Yeah that is what I think.

HERMIONE
You know the solution then don't you.


RON
Go on.

HERMIONE
Next time there's a ball pluck up the
courage and ask me before somebody else
does, and not as a last resort.

RON
Well that's completely off the point.
Harry...

Harry walks up.

HERMIONE
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off
to bed both of you.

Harry and Ron walk away.

RON
They get scary when they get older.


HERMIONE
Ron you spoil everything!


INT. BEDROOM

NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE

We're back in the old house.

VOLDERMORT
Let me see it again.

A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on
the arm.

VOLDEMORT
Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry!
At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can
give our guest a proper greeting!


Harry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking
up to his bed. It's Neville.

NEVILLE
You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!


He chuckles and dances off.


EXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS

HERMIONE
Harry you told me you'd figured the
egg out weeks ago. The task is two days
from now.

HARRY
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

HERMIONE
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually
talk about the tournament. Actually
we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's
more of a physical being. I just mean
he's not particularly... Mostly he watches
me study. It's a bit annoying actually.
You are trying to figure this egg out
aren't you?

HARRY
What's that supposed to mean?

HERMIONE
I mean these tasks are supposed to test
you, in the most brutal way they're
almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for
you. You got by the dragon mostly on
nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be
enough this time.

CEDRIC
Hey Potter.

HARRY
Cedric.

CEDRIC
How are you?

HARRY
Spectacular.

CEDRIC
Look I realise I never really thanked
you properly for tipping me off about
those dragons.

HARRY
Forget about it. I'm sure you would
have done the same for me.

CEDRIC
Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom
on the fifth floor?

Harry nods.

CEDRIC
It's not a bad place for a bath. Just
take your egg and mull things over in
the hot water.


INT. BATHROOM

Harry is taking his clothes off, he gets in the bath. He has
his golden egg on the side.

HARRY
I must be out of my mind.

He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out.

MYRTLE
I'd try putting it in the water if I
were you.

HARRY
Myrtle!

MYRTLE
Long time no see.

The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around.

MYRTLE
I was circling a blocked drain the other
day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice
potion. Not being a bad boy again are
you Harry?

HARRY
Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit.
Myrtle, did you say try putting it in
the water?

Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water.

MYRTLE
Well. That's what he did. The other
boy, the handsome one. Cedric.

Harry takes the egg and puts it under the water.

MYRTLE
Well go on, open it.

Harry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.


VOICE SINGING
Come seek us where our voices sound.
We cannot sing above the ground. An
hour long you'll have to look, to recover
what we took.

HARRY
Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the
black lake are there?

MYRTLE
Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to
riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles
were gone...

Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed.


INT. COMMON ROOM

HERMIONE
Harry, tell me again.

HARRY
Come seek us where our voices sound.


HERMIONE
The black lake, that's obvious.

HARRY
An hour long you'll have to look.

HERMIONE
Again obvious, though I must admit potentially
problematic

HARRY
Potentially problematic? When was the
last time you held your breath under
the water for an hour Hermione?

HERMIONE
Look Harry, we can do this. The three
of us can figure it out.

Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.

MAD-EYE
Hate to break up this scholar session
but Professor McGonagall would like
to see you in her office. Not you Potter,
just Weasly and Granger.

HERMIONE
But sir, the second task is only hours
away and...

MAD-EYE
Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared
by now and could do with a good night's
sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!

Neville appears from behind a bookcase.

MAD-EYE
Why don't you help Potter put his books
back.

NEVILLE
You know, if you're interested in plants
you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide
to Herbology. Do you know there's a
wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity
resistant trees?

HARRY
Neville. No offense, but I really don't
care about plants. Now if there's a
Tibetan turnip that will allow me to
breathe underwater for an hour then
great.

NEVILLE
I don't know about a turnip but you
can always use gilliweed.


EXT. LAKESIDE

The Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking
along with Neville, he has some green plantlife in his hand.


HARRY
You're sure about this Neville.

NEVILLE
Absolutely.

HARRY
For an hour.

NEVILLE
Most likely.

HARRY
Most likely?

NEVILLE
Well there is some debate among herbologists
as to the effects of freshwater versus
saltwater.

HARRY
You're telling me this now? You must
be joking.

NEVILLE
I just wanted to help.

HARRY
Well that makes you sight better than
Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?


NEVILLE
You seem a little tense Harry.

HARRY
Do I?

DUMBLEDORE
(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the
second task. Last night something was
stolen from each of our champions. A
treasure of sorts. These four treasures,
one for each champion, now lie on the
bottom of the black lake. In order to
win each champion need only find their
treasure and return to the surface.
Simple enough. Except for this, they
will have one hour to do so and one
hour only. After that they'll be on
their own.

MAD-EYE
(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.


Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.

DUMBLEDORE
(Continued) You may begin at the start
of the cannon.

The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of
them dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of
gilliweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed.



EXT. ABOVE WATER

SEAMUS
What's the matter with him?

FRIEND
I don't know I can't see him.

NEVILLE
Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!


Harry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer.



EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry swims among the fish and rocks. Singing voices start echoing.
We see Fleur get trapped, she screams.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

DUMBLEDORE
(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons
champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately
been forced to retire. She will take
no further part in this task.


EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He
finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chan and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons
tied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho
with him. Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious
merpeople appear.

HARRY
But she's my friend too!

MERPERSON
Only one.

What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that
it has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for
the surface. Harry frees Ron.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

Cedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione
next, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls
look worried.


EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable
to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the
surface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down,
he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're
helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater
Harry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he
flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry!

BARTY
Get him another towel.

DUMBLEDORE
I want all the judges over here now.


FLEUR
(To Harry) You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save. My little
sister!

Fleur kisses Harry on the face.

FLEUR
Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron).
You helped!

RON
Well... yeah... a bit

Fleur kisses him too.

RON
Merci.

Hermione comes up to Harry with a towel.

HERMIONE
Harry!

HARRY
Hermione

HERMIONE
Are you alright? You must be freezing!
Personally I think you behaved admirably.


Hermione kisses Harry on the head.

HARRY
I finished last Hermione.

HERMIONE
Next to last.

DUMBLEDORE
Attention! Attention! The winner is...
Mr Diggory!

Cedric and his friends cheer.

DUMBLEDORE
For showing unique command of the bubblehead
shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would
have finished first had it not been
for his determination to rescue not
only Mr Weasly but the others as well.
We've agreed to award him second place!
For outstanding moral fibre.


As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering
him.

FRED
All that moral fibre eh?

RON
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns
out right.

GEORGE
Well done 'moral fibre'.


Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry.

BARTY
Congratulations Potter, fine achievement.
Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't
spoken, after all your story is one
I've heard many times. Quite remarkable.
Tragic of course, to lose one's family.
Never whole again are we? Still, life
goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure
your parents would be very proud today
Potter.

Mad-Eye approaches them.

MAD-EYE
Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter
into one of the ministry's summer internships
are we? Last boy who went into the department
of ministries never came out!

Barty walks away from him.

MAD-EYE
And they say I'm mad.


EXT. DARK FOREST

HAGRID
So I remember, I remember when I first
met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits
I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded
me of myself a little. And here we all
are, four years later.

RON
We're still misfits.

HAGRID
Maybe. But we've all got each other,
and Harry of course. Soon to be! The
youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's
ever been! Hooray!

They walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head
in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless.


HARRY
Mr Crouch?


INT. HOGWARTS DARK ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
A man has died here. And he won't be
the last, you must take action.

FUDGE
I will not. In times like these the
wizard world looks to its leaders for
strength Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Then for once show them some.

FUDGE
The tri-wizard tournament will not be
cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.


DUMBLEDORE
But surely that is what's right, no
matter what others think.

FUDGE
What did you say? What did you say to
me?

MAD-EYE
Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest
you to know that this conversation is
no longer private.

Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters.

FUDGE
Harry! Harry how good to see you again.


HARRY
I can come back later Professor.

DUMBLEDORE
Oh not necessary Harry the minister
and I are done. I'll be back in a moment.
Minister, after you. Harry do feel free
to indulge in a liquorice snack in my
absence, but I have to warn you they're
a little bit sharp.

Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl
and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips
at his hand.

HARRY
Agh!

A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool
of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time
and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore
is seated next to where Harry is.


INT. COURTROOM

HARRY
Professor?

The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks.

MAN
Professor.

Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through
Harry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence.
Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor.


BARTY
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request to
present evidence to this counsel. Should
your testimony prove consequential.
Counsel may be prepared to order your
immediate release. Until such time you
remain in the eyes of the ministry a
convicted deatheater. Do you accept
these terms?

IGOR
I do sir.

BARTY
What do you wish to present?

IGOR
I have names sir. There was a Rosier,
Evan Rosier.

BARTY
Mr Rosier is dead.

IGOR
Dead?

MAD-EYE
(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of
me with him though didn't he.

Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.

IGOR
I didn't know.

BARTY
If that is all the witness has to offer...


IGOR
No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a
spy.

BARTY
Augustus Rookwood? Of the department
of ministries.

IGOR
Ya ya, the same. He passed information
to you know who from inside the ministry
itself.

BARTY
Very well. Counsel will deliberate.
In the meantime you will be returned
to Azkaban.

IGOR
NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,
Severus Snape.

DUMBLEDORE
The counsel is very much aware you have
given evidence on this matter. Severus
Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior
to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned
spy for us at great personal risk. Today
he's no more a deatheater than I am.


Igor protests loudly.

IGOR
It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful
to the dark lord.

BARTY
Silence!

Barty hits the gavel repeatedly.

BARTY
Unless the witness possesses any name
of genuine consequence this session
is now concluded.

IGOR
Oh no no no no no. I heard about one
more.

BARTY
What's that?

IGOR
The name...

BARTY
Yes?

IGOR
I know for a fact this person took part
in the capture, and by means of the
cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer
Frank Longbottom and...

BARTY
The name! Give me the wretched name!


IGOR
Barty Crouch! ... Junior.

Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic,
he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar.
Guards seize Barty junior.

BARTY JR
Get your hands off me you pathetic little
men. Hello father.

BARTY
You are no son of mine.

BARTY JR
GAHHHH!

Harry steps out of the blue pool and we're back in the darkened
room.

DUMBLEDORE
Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you
should exercise caution. It's a pensieve,
useful if like me you find your mind
a wee bit stretched. It allows me to
see what small things I've already seen.
You see Harry I've searched and searched
for something, some small detail. Something
I might have overlooked, something that
would explain why these terrible things
have happened. Every time I get close
to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.


HARRY
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened
to him?

DUMBLEDORE
He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty
to do it. But he had no choice, the
evidence was overwhelming. Why do you
ask?

HARRY
It's just that I had a dream about him.
It was in the summer, before school.
In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort
was there only he wasn't quite human,
and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's
son.

DUMBLEDORE
Have there been other dreams like this?


HARRY
Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these
dreams, what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening do you?

DUMBLEDORE
I think it's unwise for you to linger
over these dreams Harry, I think it's
best that you simply...

Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic
out from his head.

DUMBLEDORE
Cast them away.


INT. CORRIDOR

Harry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the
herbs store.

IGOR
It's a sign Severus, you know what it
means as well as I.

The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves.


SEVERUS
Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations,
your performance in the black lake was
inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?


HARRY
Yes sir.

SEVERUS
Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed,
not something found in your every day
garden. Nor is this, know what it is?


HARRY
Bubble juice sir?

SEVERUS
Veritaserum. Three drops of this and
you-know-who himself will spill his
darkest secrets. The use of this on
a student is regrettably forbidden,
however should you ever steal from my
personal stores again, my hand might
just slip over your morning pumpkin
juice.

HARRY
I haven't stolen anything.

SEVERUS
Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be
innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing
flies? You and your friends are brewing
polyjuice potion and believe me I'm
going to find out why.

Severus closes the door in Harry's face.


EXT. ARENA

Music is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions
emerge.

DUMBLEDORE
Earlier today Professor Moody placed
the tri-wizards cup deep within the
maze. Only he knows its exact position.
Now as Mr Diggory...

The crowd cheer on hearing his name.

DUMBLEDORE
(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first
position they will be the first to enter
the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...

The bulgarian crowd go nuts.

DUMBLEDORE
(continued) The first person to touch
the cup will be the winner. I've instructed
the staff to patrol the perimeter, if
at any point should a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task he or she
need only send up red sparks with their
wands. Contestants, gather round.


DUMBLEDORE
(To the contestants) In the maze you'll
find not dragons or creatures of the
deep. Instead you'll face something
more challenging. You see, people change
in the maze. Oh find the cup if you
can, but be very weary you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

MAD-EYE
Champions! Prepare yourselves.

Cedric hugs his father.

DUMBLEDORE
On the count of three... ONE...

The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.
Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances.
The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan
out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing
the maze, creature noises are all around.

Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on
him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she
is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's
unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being
swallowed into the undergrowth.

HARRY
Fleur? Fleur!

He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into
the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry
runs. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves
towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.

CEDRIC
Get down!

Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up
and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at
Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes.


HARRY
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.

They struggle.

CEDRIC
Get off me!

HARRY
He's bewitched!

The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth
grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric
is pinned down with no means of escape.

CEDRIC
Harry! Harry!

Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps
him up.

CEDRIC
You know for a moment there I thought
you were gonna let it get me.

HARRY
For a moment so did I.

CEDRIC
Some game huh?

HARRY
Some game.

The wind starts blowing again.

CEDRIC
Go. Take it, you saved me!

HARRY
Together, on three. One, two, three!



EXT. GRAVEYARD

Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard.

CEDRIC
You ok?

HARRY
Yeah, you?

CEDRIC
Where are we?

HARRY
I've been here before.

CEDRIC
It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.


HARRY
I've been here before in a dream. Cedric,
we have to get back to the cup? Now!


CEDRIC
What are you talking about?

Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain.

CEDRIC
What is it?

HARRY
Get back to the cup!

We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby.

CEDRIC
Who are you? What do you want?

VOLDEMORT
Kill the spare.

Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.

HARRY
Cedric!

Cedric lays dead on the ground.

Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and
traps him.

VOLDEMORT
Do it, now!

Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on.


WORMTAIL
Bones of the father, unwillingly given.


A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it
into the cauldron.

WORMTAIL
Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.


He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.

WORMTAIL
Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.


He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts.
Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops
fall into it.

WORMTAIL
The dark lord shall rise again.

The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.


VOLDEMORT
My wand Wormtail.

Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.

VOLDEMORT
Hold out your arm.

WORMTAIL
Master. Thank you master.

VOLDEMORT
The other arm Wormtail.

Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks
the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been
summoned.

VOLDEMORT
Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's
been, and yet you stand before me as
though it were only yesterday. I confess
myself disappointed, not one of you
tried to find me.

Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.

VOLDEMORT
Not even you, Lucius.

LUCIUS
My lord. Had I detected any sign or
even a whisper of your whereabouts.


VOLDEMORT
There were signs my friend, and more
than whispers.

LUCIUS
I assure you I never renounced the old
ways. The face I have been obliged to
present each day since your absence,
that was my true mask.

WORMTAIL
I returned.

VOLDEMORT
Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you
have proved yourself useful these past
few months Wormtail.

Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.

WORMTAIL
Thank you master, thank you.

VOLDEMORT
(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome
boy.

HARRY
Don't touch him.

Harry struggles to get free.

VOLDEMORT
Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were
here. Standing on the bones of my father.
I'd introduce you but word has it you're
almost as famous as me these days. The
boy who lived. How lies have fed your
legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really
happened that night thirteen years ago?
Shall I divulge how I truly lost my
powers? It was love. You see when dear
sweet Lily Potter gave her life for
her only son she provided the ultimate
protection. I could not touch you. It
was old magic, something I should have
forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things
have changed, I can touch you now!


Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.

VOLDEMORT
Astonishing what a few drops of your
blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your
wand Potter. I said pick it up, get
up. Get up! You've been taught how to
duel I presume yes? First we bow to
each other. Come on now Harry the niceties
must be observed, Dumbledore would not
want you to forget your manners now
would he? I said bow!

Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.

VOLDEMORT
That's better. And now...

Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain.

VOLDEMORT
Atta boy Harry, your parents would be
proud. Especially your filthy mongrel
mother. I'm going to kill you Harry
Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After
tonight no one will ever again question
my powers. After tonight if they speak
of you they'll speak only of how you
begged for death, and I being a merciful
lord obliged. Get up.

Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away.


VOLDEMORT
Don't you turn your back on me Harry
Potter I want you to look at me when
I kill you, I want to see the lights
leave your eyes.

Harry takes steps toward Voldemort.

HARRY
Have it your way.

They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.


VOLDEMORT
Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's
mine!

Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's
voice.

HARRY'S DAD
(voice) Harry when the connection is
broken you must get to the portkey.
We can delay it for a moment to give
you time but only a moment, do you understand?


CEDRIC
(voice) Harry take my body back will
you? Take my body back to my father.


HARRY'S MOTHER
(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready.
Let go! Let go!

The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons
the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks
angry.

VOLDEMORT
No!


EXT. ARENA

Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd
don't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant
music starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric's body.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Harry!

Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body.

DUMBLEDORE
Tell me what happened!

HARRY
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body
back. I couldn't leave him, not there.


DUMBLEDORE
It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's
home, you both are.

FUDGE
Keep everybody in their seats. A boy
has just been killed. The body must
be moved Dumbledore, there are... too
many people.

AMOS
Let me through! That's my son! My boy!


Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.


INT. DARKENED ROOM

Mad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is
in the room still sobbing. They sit.

MAD-EYE
Are you alright Potter?

Harry nods.

MAD-EYE
Does it hurt?

HARRY
Not so much now.

MAD-EYE
I'd better take a look at it.

We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.

HARRY
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched
it.

MAD-EYE
What was it like? What was he like?

HARRY
Who?

MAD-EYE
The dark lord. What was it like to stand
in his presence?

HARRY
I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into
one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.


Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for
his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles
and struggles to find one.

MAD-EYE
Were there others? In the graveyard,
were there others?

HARRY
Um. I don't think I said anything about
a graveyard Professor.

MAD-EYE
Marvellous creatures dragons aren't
they? Do you think that miserable oaf
would have led you into the woods if
I hadn't suggested it? Do you think
Cedric Diggory would have told you to
hold the egg under the water if I hadn't
have told him first myself? Do you think
Neville Longbottom the witless wonder
could have provided you with gilliweed
if I hadn't have given him the book
that led you straight to it? Huh??

HARRY
It was you from the beginning. You put
my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched
Krum. But...

Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.

MAD-EYE
You won because I made it so Potter.
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so. And now
the deed is done. The blood that runs
through these veins runs within the
dark lord. Imagine how he will reward
me when he learns that I have once and
for all silenced the great Harry Potter.

A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.
Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye
by the neck...

DUMBLEDORE
Severus...

Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.


DUMBLEDORE
Do you know who I am?

MAD-EYE
Albus Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?

MAD-EYE
No.

DUMBLEDORE
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

We see a nod.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry get away from there!

Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains
a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see
that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.

DUMBLEDORE
Are you alright Alastor?

ALASTOR
I'm sorry Albus.

HARRY
That's Moody, but then who's...?

Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.

SEVERUS
Polyjuice potion.

DUMBLEDORE
Now we know who's been stealing it from
your store Severus.

Dumbledore looks into the pit.

DUMBLEDORE
We'll get you up in a minute.

Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in
a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises.
He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece
which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty
Crouch Junior.

DUMBLEDORE
Barty Crouch Junior.

BARTY JR
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.


Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.


DUMBLEDORE
Your arm Harry.

BARTY JR
You know what this means don't you?
He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.


DUMBLEDORE
Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll
find they're missing a prisoner.


BARTY JR
I'll be welcomed back like a hero.


DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps. Personally I've never had much
time for heroes.


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge
a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory
was as you all know, exceptionally hard
working, intricately fair minded. And
most importantly a fierce fierce friend.
I think therefore you have the right
to know exactly how he died. You see,
Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord
Voldemort. The ministry of magic does
not wish me to tell you this. But not
to do so I think would be an insult
to his memory. Now the pain we all feel
at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds
us that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues,
our hearts beat as one. In light of
recent events the bonds of friendship
we made this year will be more important
than ever. Remember that and Cedric
Diggory will not have died in vain,
you remember that. And we'll celebrate
a boy who was kind and honest and brave
and true right to the very end.


INT. BEDROOM

Harry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.

DUMBLEDORE
I never liked these curtains. Set them
on fire in my fourth year, by accident
of course. I put you in terrible danger
this year Harry I'm sorry.

HARRY
Professor, when I was in the graveyard
there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's
wand and mine sort of connected.

DUMBLEDORE
Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents
that night didn't you? They reappeared.


Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE
No spell can reawaken the dead Harry
I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult
times lie ahead. Soon we must all face
the choice between what is right what
is easy. But remember this, you have
friends here. You're not alone.


EXT. HOGWARTS

There's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor
Krum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper.

VIKTOR
Write to me. Promise.

HERMIONE
Bye.

Ron is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both
in turn give him a kiss on the head.

FLEUR
Au revoir Ron.

The Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The
Durmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go.

RON
Do you think we'll ever just have a
quiet year at Hogwarts?

HERMIONE
No.

HARRY
No I don't think so.

HERMIONE
Everything's going to change now isn't
it?

HARRY
Yes.

HERMIONE
Promise you'll write this summer. Both
of you.

RON
Well I won't. You know I won't!

HERMIONE
Harry will won't you?

HARRY
Yeah. Every week.

They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage
head off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater.

FADE OUT.
I don't know about you, it's
just too hot today, isn't it?
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
So, please, remember to
cover up and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
Come on, guys, time to go home.
Come on, love, off you get.
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
Beat up another
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
"Don't kill Cedric."
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."
Where is your mum?
Where is your mum, Potter?
She dead?
Is she dead?
Is she a dead Pott...?
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
Dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
Don't put away your wand, Harry.
They might come back.
Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. -
I don't understand. How do you know...?
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let
you go wandering on your own?
Good Lord, boy. They told
me you were intelligent.
Now, get inside and stay there.
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
There's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
Is that you?
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
We're going to have to take him to a hospital.
Who did this to you, boy?
Happy, are we, now?
You've finally done it. You've
finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
Well, just look at him,
Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
This is the last I'm gonna
take of you and your nonsense.
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus
Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
As a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
Justice.
He's not very well.
Sorry, Hedwig.
Very clean, these Muggles.
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.
Professor Moody.
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.
But where are we going? The
letter said I've been expelled.
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.
But the letter said...
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...
- ... pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.
Not here, Nymphadora.
Don't call me Nymphadora.
Stay in formation, everyone. Don't
break ranks if one of us is killed.
Come on, you, around the corner.
Come on.
In you go, son.
There've been no sightings.
No deaths. No proof.
He almost killed Harry. If
that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...
We must trust Dumbledore on this.
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
Heavens, you're all right.
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will
wait until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain. Straight
upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
If my poor mistress knew the
scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.
Scum of the earth. Not like it
was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.
And this hearing at the
Ministry. It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up. They
simply can't expel you.
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.
So, what is this place?
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.
It's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back
when they fought You-Know-Who.
Couldn't have put any of
this in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
- Only...
- Only what?
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
But why would he keep me in
the dark? Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him, who
saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?
If anyone has a right to know, it's
Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...
...we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.
He's not a child, Molly.
But he's not an adult either.
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.
He's as good as.
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be
a felon, just like his godfather.
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.
...about your supposed reformation.
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?
- Get off it.
- Quick.
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
You hungry, Harry?
You sure you're all right,
Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
This is very, very peculiar.
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has the
Ministry of Magic got against me?
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
No one in their right
mind could believe that...
Exactly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.
It's been twisted and warped by fear.
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.
The last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the
minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
We think Voldemort wants
to build up his army again.
Fourteen years ago, he had
huge numbers at his command.
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested in.
We believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
Something he didn't have last time.
You mean like a weapon?
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.
You say more and you might as
well induct him into the Order.
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
You are hereby expelled.
Before the entire Wizengamot.
Trains. Underground.
Ingenious, these Muggles.
Here we are.
I've never used the visitors'
entrance before. Should be fun.
Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.
Daily Prophet, ladies and
gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.
Interdepartmental memos.
We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?
In five minutes.
Department of Mysteries.
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be...
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
As the Muggles say, truth will out.
Yes?
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
Good luck, Harry.
Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet
Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius
Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
Witness for the defense.
Albus Percival Wulfric...
...Brian Dumbledore.
You got our message that the
time and place of the hearing...
- ... had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.
The charges?
The charges against the
accused are as follows:
"That he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness of
the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle."
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...
- ... while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
Dementors?
In Little Whinging?
That's quite clever.
Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...
Pardon me, minister, but
as it happens, we can.
Please describe the attack.
What did they look like?
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.
Not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, big.
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.
Now, look here. Dementors don't
just wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have
misunderstood you, professor.
Dementors are, after all, under the
control of the Ministry of Magic.
And it's so silly of me, but it
sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an
attack without authorization.
Of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.
He is not back.
In the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.
Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple
matter of underage magic?
Those in favor of conviction?
Those in favor of clearing
the accused of all charges?
Cleared of all charges.
Professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
You'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
What's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you get
chucked back in Azkaban.
Don't worry about me.
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
Original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
She was killed two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
They suffered a fate worse
than death, you ask me.
It's been 14 years.
And still a day doesn't go
by I don't miss your dad.
Do you really think there's
going to be a war, Sirius?
It feels like it did before.
You keep it.
Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
Hold my hand, lovey.
There they are. They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.
Better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in
Azkaban with your name on it.
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!
It's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.
What is it?
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
It's pulling itself, like always.
You're not going mad.
I can see them too.
You're just as sane as I am.
Everyone, this is Loony Love...
Luna Lovegood.
What an interesting necklace.
It's a charm, actually.
Keeps away the Nargles.
Hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.
Good evening, children.
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking Care
of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
Filch, has asked me to remind you...
She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
Thank you, headmaster, for
those kind words of welcome.
And how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.
- That's likely.
- That's likely.
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.
Although each headmaster...
...has brought something new
to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of
progress must be discouraged.
Let us preserve what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
- Good holiday?
- All right.
Better than Seamus', anyway.
Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.
What, your mum believes them?
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
- You all right?
- Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.
Right. I'll just leave
you to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
Bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
Good morning, children.
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
O-W-Ls.
More commonly known as OWLs.
Study hard and you will be rewarded.
Fail to do so, and the
consequences may be severe.
Your previous instruction in this
subject has been disturbingly uneven.
But you'll be pleased to know, from now on...
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?
Using spells?
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.
We're not gonna use magic?
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risk-free way.
What use is that? If we're
attacked, it won't be risk-free.
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.
It is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical
knowledge will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all, is
what school is all about.
And how's theory supposed to
prepare us for what's out there?
There is nothing out there, dear.
Who do you imagine wants to
attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
Now, let me make this quite plain.
You have been told...
...that a certain dark
wizard is at large once again.
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
Detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
Enough!
Enough.
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
Come in.
Good evening, Mr. Potter.
Sit.
You're going to be doing some
lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
No, not with your quill.
Going to be using a
rather special one of mine.
Now...
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."
How many times?
Well, let's say for as long as it
takes for the message to sink in.
You haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
Yes?
- Nothing.
- That's right.
Because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
Don't you, Mr. Potter?
Go on.
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.
Get out of class whenever you like.
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.
Care for another?
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.
What's wrong with your hand?
Nothing.
The other hand.
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.
Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
You don't understand.
Then help us to.
Dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people, will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...
Different.
But why can't the others see them?
They can only be seen by
people who've seen death.
So you've known someone who's died, then?
My mum.
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...
...and one day, one of her
spells went badly wrong.
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it
sometimes, but I've got Dad.
We both believe you, by the way.
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the
Prophet are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're
about the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
What do you mean?
Well, if I were
You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut
off from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
Can I join you?
Pardon me, professor, but what
exactly are you insinuating?
I am merely requesting that
when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.
So silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
Not at all, Dolores, merely
your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing I will
not stand for is disloyalty.
Disloyalty.
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
What's happened to Dumbledore?
Having already revolutionized...
...the teaching of Defense
Against the Dark Arts...
...Dolores Umbridge will, as
high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.
Just one question, dear.
You've been in this post how long, exactly?
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
But you were unsuccessful?
Obviously.
Could you please predict something for me?
I'm sorry?
Move those mouths.
One teensy little prophecy?
Pity.
No, wait. Wait, no. I
think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
You are in grave danger.
Lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
It's Professor Trelawney.
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
You can't do this.
Actually, I can.
Something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several
things I would like to say.
There...
Professor McGonagall, might I ask
you to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
Thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind
you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number
You have the right to dismiss my teachers.
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.
That power remains with the headmaster.
For now.
Don't you all have studying to do?
Professor.
Professor?
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
Professor Dumbledore.
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.
She's taking over the entire school.
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.
Furthermore, we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances are the work...
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.
You said you were worried about
Umbridge. What's she doing?
Training you to kill half-breeds?
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.
Combat?
What does he think, we're
forming some sort of wizard army?
That's exactly what he thinks.
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the Ministry.
He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going
at all well with the Order.
Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
Well, what can we do?
Someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
But for now, at least, it
looks like you're on your own.
He really is out there, isn't he?
We've got to be able to defend ourselves.
And if Umbridge refuses to teach
us how, we need someone who will.
Harry.
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
Look on the bright side: you can't
be any worse than old toad face.
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
Just a couple of people.
Lovely spot.
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.
Matey, come back here.
Hi.
So you all know why we're here.
We need a teacher.
A proper teacher.
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.
- Why?
- Why?
Because You-Know-Who's
back, you tosspot.
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.
So Dumbledore says because he says.
The point is, where's the proof?
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
Blimey, Harry. I didn't
know you could do that.
And he killed a basilisk, with
the sword in Dumbledore's office.
It's true.
Third year, he fought off about
a hundred Dementors at once.
Last year, he really did fight
off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
Wait.
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...
...but the truth is, most
of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing half
the time. I nearly always had help.
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.
Facing this stuff in real
life is not like school.
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.
But out there...
...when you're a second
away from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...
You don't know what that's like.
You're right, Harry, we don't.
That's why we need your help.
Because if we're going to
have any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
He's really back.
Right. First we need to
find a place to practice...
...where Umbridge won't find out.
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
Who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting,
isn't it, breaking the rules?
Who are you and what have
you done with Hermione?
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.
What's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
Right. Over the next few
days, we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.
We've got to make sure, wherever it
is, there's no chance she can find us.
Will do, Harry.
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
You've done it, Neville. You
found the Room of Requirement.
The what?
It's also known as the Come and Go Room.
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.
So say you really needed the toilet...
Charming, Ronald. But, yes,
that is the general idea.
It's brilliant. It's like
Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
You're just flourishing your wand too
much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
You will please copy the
approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.
Stunning is one of the most
useful spells in your arsenal.
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.
- One Sickle.
- You're on.
Stupefy.
- Thank you.
- Shut up.
I let her do that. It's
good manners, isn't it?
It was completely intentional.
Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
Very good. Keep your concentration.
Great.
A little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.
Diminuendo.
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:
Believing in yourself.
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.
Think of it this way.
Every great wizard in
history has started out...
...as nothing more than
what we are now: students.
If they can do it, why not us?
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
So that's it for this lesson.
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays.
So just keep practicing on
your own as best you can.
And well done, everyone. Great, great work.
Well done, mate.
Thanks.
See you after Christmas.
See you in the Common Room, Harry.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...
Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
Anyway, it's worth it.
It's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder
whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
He was really good.
It's just, Voldemort was better.
You're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
Mistletoe.
Probably full of Nargles, though.
What are Nargles?
No idea.
Well, how was it?
Wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
That bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
You'd think a bit of
snogging would cheer her up.
Don't you understand how she must be feeling?
Well, obviously she's
feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.
One person couldn't feel
all that. They'd explode.
Just because you've got the
emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
Something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
In the dream, were you
standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
Neither. It was like I...
Will you please just tell me what's happening?
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
Make sure he's found by the right people.
- Sir.
- Phineas.
You must go to your
portrait at Grimmauld Place.
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be
arriving there soon by Portkey.
They've got him, Albus. It was
close, but they think he'll make it.
What's more, the Dark
Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
Look at me!
What's happening to me?
You wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't
wait. Not even till the morning.
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
It appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.
Pray he remains ignorant.
You mean, if he knows about it, then...
- ... he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.
Only after extracting the last
exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
Used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you
from access or influence.
In these lessons, I will
attempt to penetrate your mind.
You will attempt to resist.
Prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
Here we go.
Daddy's back.
Sit down, everybody, sit
down. That's it. Now, presents.
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
There you are.
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.
To Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
- Harry.
- Harry.
Harry.
That is delicious. I shall
be needing some more of that.
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you
don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
No more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the Dark Lord.
Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!
That's enough of your bile. Away with you!
Of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.
Sorry about that.
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.
Not to me, anyway.
What, you grew up here?
This is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.
About the only useful
thing I've been able to do.
This is the Black family tree.
My deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
My parents with their pure-blood mania.
My mother did that after I ran away.
Charming woman.
I was 16.
Where did you go?
Round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
You are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
When I saw Mr. Weasley
attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
This connection between me and Voldemort.
What if the reason for it is
that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside
me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry.
You're not a bad person.
You're a very good person who
bad things have happened to.
You understand?
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.
We've all got both light
and dark inside of us.
What matters is the part we choose to act on.
That's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.
You'll see.
Come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh
air must be difficult to come by.
If I were you, I shouldn't
get too used to being back.
In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
This is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
Giants?
You found them?
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
But I wasn't the only one that
was trying to win them over.
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.
Suppose some of them remember he
was friendly to them. I suppose.
And they did this to you?
Not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
It's changing out there.
Just like last time.
There's a storm coming, Harry.
We'd all best be ready when she does.
We have confirmed that 10
high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of
yesterday evening did escape.
And of course, the Muggle prime
minister has been alerted to the danger.
We strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
He's gonna get us all killed just
because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.
So, what I'm really trying
to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
Fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
She tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.
We're gonna make them proud,
Neville. That's a promise.
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.
Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
A full-bodied Patronus is the
most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.
Wow, that was really good.
Fantastic, Ginny.
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.
So focus, Luna.
Think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.
This is really advanced stuff,
guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
Get them.
Been watching them for weeks.
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
We saw your lies for what they were:
A smokescreen for your bid to
seize control of the Ministry.
Naturally.
No, professor. He had nothing
to do with it. It was me.
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield
me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
And I, and I alone, am
responsible for its activities.
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.
Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you
will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
You seem to be laboring under
the delusion that I'm going to...
What was the phrase?
...come quietly.
Well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
Enough of this.
Take him.
Well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
Boys and girls are not permitted to
be within eight inches of each other.
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.
Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
You did everything you could. No
one could win against that old hag.
Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all
it's done is make things worse.
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?
To go it alone.
Hagrid.
Any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
And they're dangerous at the best of times.
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...
...they'll have a full
uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all
with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting
the sack any day now.
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
Down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
Brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
Because he's my brother.
Blimey.
Well, half brother, really.
He's completely harmless, just like
I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.
We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
That's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
Put me down.
Now.
You all right?
Fine.
Just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
You just stay away from her, all right?
He gets his own food and all.
It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
You will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
Feeling sentimental?
- That's private.
- Not to me.
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.
Every memory he has access to is
a weapon he can use against you.
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.
You're just like your father.
Lazy, arrogant.
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.
Control your emotions.
Discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
Stop it.
Is this what you call control?
We've been at it for
hours. If I could just rest.
The Dark Lord isn't resting.
You and Black, you're two of a kind.
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
Well, it may have escaped your
notice, but life isn't fair.
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.
- Legilimens.
- Protego.
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
Nice one, James.
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
Enough.
Enough.
Your lessons are at an end.
I...
Get out.
- What's your name?
- Michael.
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
It's fading already.
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
You know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay
outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.
All right, professor!
Here you go.
Ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
You'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first,
you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
It's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
Something he didn't have the last
time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
What do we do?
We'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
Not all of them.
Alohomora.
Alert the Order if you can.
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.
When are you going to get it into
your head? We're in this together.
That you are.
Caught this one trying
to help the Weasley girl.
You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
- No.
- Liar.
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.
Have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all
my stores interrogating students.
The last of it on Miss Chang.
Unless you wish to poison him...
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.
...I cannot help you.
He's got Padfoot.
He's got Padfoot at the
place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?
What is he talking about, Snape?
No idea.
Very well.
You give me no choice, Potter.
As this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
The Cruciatus Curse ought
to loosen your tongue.
That's illegal.
What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
Tell her, Harry!
Tell me what?
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
Where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
How much further?
Not far.
It had to be somewhere students
wouldn't find it accidentally.
What are you doing?
Improvising.
Well?
Where is this weapon?
There isn't one, is there?
You were trying to trick me.
You know...
...I really hate children.
You have no business here,
centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
Lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
How dare you?
Filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
Please. Please stop it. Please.
Now, enough. I will have order.
You filthy animal.
Do you know who I am?
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.
No, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
But I must not tell lies.
What are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.
Let me go!
Thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.
That was clever, Ron.
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.
So how are we getting to London?
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into
enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to
be about doing something real.
Or was that all just words to you?
Maybe you don't have to do
this all by yourself, mate.
So how are we going to get to London?
We fly, of course.
Department of Mysteries.
This is it.
Ninety-two.
Ninety-three.
Ninety-four.
Ninety-five.
- He should be here.
- Harry.
It's got your name on it.
The one with the power to
vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
And the Dark Lord shall
mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.
For neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
You know, you really should learn to
tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.
Now, hand me the prophecy.
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
He knows how to play.
Itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
Better, now they're about to be avenged.
Now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
All we want is that prophecy.
Why did Voldemort need
me to come and get this?
You dare speak his name?
You filthy half-blood!
It's all right. He's just
a curious lad, aren't you?
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.
Which is lucky for you, really.
Haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the
connection between you and the Dark Lord?
Why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.
All you have to do...
...is give it to me.
Then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a
little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
Well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
Get back to the door.
Department of Mysteries. They
got that bit right, didn't they?
The voices.
Can you tell what they're saying?
There aren't any voices, Harry.
Let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
Please, Harry.
Get behind me.
Did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
Give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
Don't give it to him, Harry.
Get away from my godson.
Now, listen to me. Take the
others and get out of here.
What? No, I'm staying with you.
You've done beautifully.
Now, let me take it from here.
Black.
Expelliarmus!
Nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
No. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.
You've got to mean it, Harry.
She killed him. She deserves it.
You know the spell, Harry.
Do it.
So weak.
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, T om.
The Aurors are on their way.
By which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
You've lost, old man.
Harry.
So weak.
So vulnerable.
Look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
It's how you are not.
Harry?
You're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
And I feel sorry for you.
You're a fool, Harry Potter.
And you will lose everything.
He's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
No, you don't.
It's my fault.
No, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...
...he'd be less tempted, and
therefore you might be more protected.
The prophecy said:
"Neither one can live while
the other one survives."
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
The same reason your friends saved you.
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
How come you're not at the feast?
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.
That's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.
Do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
Are you sure you don't want any help looking?
That's all right.
Anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.
If not always in the way we expect.
Think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about
something Dumbledore said to me.
What's that?
That even though we've
got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.
Yeah?
Something worth fighting for.
Millenium breaking disaster... All river traffic has been halted and police divers search for survivors. Surrounding area remains closed. The man, known to... Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter? Um, no one. Bit of a tosser, really. Funny that paper of yours. Couple of minutes ago, I could have sworn I saw a picture move. Really? While I was going around the train. Okay, I was wondering-- Eleven. That's when I get off. You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter. You've been reckless this summer, Harry. I like riding around the trains. Takes my mind off things. All unpleasant to be old, isn't it? The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself. But now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm. Do as I say. I hardly just Apparated, didn't I? Indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add. Most people vomit the first time. Can't imagine why. Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. Harry, I assume right about now you must be wondering... why I brought you here? Am I right? Actually sir, after all these years, I just, sort of, go with it. Wands on, Harry. Horace! Horace. Merlin's beard! You don't need to disfigure me, Albus. Well I must say you made a very convincing armchair, Horace. It's all in the upholstery. I come by this stuffing naturally. What gave me away? Dragon's blood. Oh yes, introductions. Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine-- Horace Slughorn. Horace... Well you know who this is. Harry Potter. So for love of theatrics, Horace... You're, by any chance, waiting for someone else, were you? Someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Alright. The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. Do you know what's that like? You can only say no to these people so many times. So I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands. Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Yes. Fine. That was fun. Do you mind if I use the loo? No, of course. Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus. The answer is still no. Absolutely, and unequivanetly, no. You're very like your father. Except the eyes, of course. You have your-- My mother's eyes, yeah. Lily, lovely Lily. She's exceedingly bright, your mother. Even more impressive even though I could say that she was Muggle-born. One of my best friends is Muggle-born. She's the best in our year. Oh please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no, no. Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is. Right at the front. All mine. Each and every one. Ex-students, I mean. You recognise Barnabas Cuffe? Editor of the Daily Prophet. Always takes my owl should I wish to register an opinion on the news of the day. Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies. Free tickets whenever I want them. Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time. Ah, yes! Regulus Black. No doubt, there is his older brother Sirius, died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius. It's a shame. A talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but... but I'd like to set. Horace! Do you mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns. Yes, of course, but you're not leaving, are you? Oh, I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable, I would have considered it a very personal triumph if you consented to return to Hogwarts. Ah well, you're like my friend Mr. Potter here. One of a kind. Well, bye-bye Horace. Bye. Alright. I'll do it. But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. And I expect a raise. These are mad times we're living, mad! They are, indeed. Sir, exactly what was all that about? You are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn's gonna try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return. I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was truthfully... very pretty. The girl. It's alright, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse. Oh you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. But sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk? Both are waiting for you. Hedwig? Mom? Ginny, what is it? I was only wondering when Harry got here. What? Harry-- Harry, who? Harry Potter, of course. I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I? His trunk's in the kitchen... and his owl. But no, dear. I seriously doubt that. Harry? Did someone say Harry? Me, nosey. Is he up there with you? Of course not. I think I'll know if my best friend's in my room, wouldn't I? Is that an owl I heard? You haven't seen him, have you? Apparently, he's wandering about the house. Really? Really. Harry! Harry. What a lovely surprise! Why didn't you let us know you were coming? I didn't know. Dumbledore. Oh, that man! What we won't do without him? A bit of... toothpaste. So when did you get here? A few days ago. Day or for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming. Mum... sort of lost it, last week. Said Ginny and I have no business going back to Hogwarts. It's too dangerous. Oh, come on. She's not alone. Even my parents. They're Muggles, know something bad's happening. Anyway, Dad stepped in. Told us she was being barmy and... Took a few days, but she came around. But, this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer? There's been a lot of talk recently that... Dumbledore's got a bit old. What rubbish! Well, he's only... How old is he? Give or take a few years? Cissy, you can't do this! He can't be trusted. The Dark Lord trusts him. The Dark Lord is mistaken. Run along, Wormtail. I-I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this. If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you would not to speak. Put it down, Bella, we mustn't touch what isn't ours. As it, so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa. You? The Dark Lord told you? Your sister darts me. Understandable, over the years, I've played my part well. So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it. I don't doubt you, Severus. You should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco. He's just a boy. I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. Severus. Swear to it. Make the Unbreakable Vow. It's just empty words. You'll give it his best effort... when it matters most. He'll just slither back to his hole. Coward. Take out your wand. Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes? I will. And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm? I will. And if Draco should fail, will you yourself carry out the deed the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform? I will. Step up, step up! We got fating fancies. And he's made me go. At just in for time for school. Puking Pastilles. Meeting's in the cauldron, Hanson. Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. How real many spinned it at that one? Handy if you need to make a quick getaway. Hello, ladies. Love potions, eh? Yeah. They really do work. Then again the way we heard you, sis... You're doing just fine on your own. Meaning? Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? It's none of your business. How much for this? Five galleons. Five galleons. How much for me? Five galleons. Five galleons. I'm your brother. Ten galleons. Ten galleons. Come on, let's go. Hi, Ron. Hi. How are Fred and George doing it? Half the alley's closed down. Fred reckons people need a laugh these days. I reckon he's right. Oh, no. Everyone got their wands from Ollivanders. Harry... Is it me or do Draco and Mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed? Quibbler! Quibbler. He's lovely. They've been known to sing at Boxing Day, you know? Quibbler? Oh, please. What's a Wrackspurt? Invisible creatures, they flow in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler! So what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? And who were all those people? Don't you see? It was a ceremony. An initiation. Stop it, Harry. I know where you're going with this. It happened. He's one of them. One of who? Harry's under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater. You're barking. What would You-Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy? Oh, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture? It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy blood. Blood? His father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides, Hermione saw it with her own eyes. I told you, I don't know what I saw. I need some air. What's going on? What's in that? What's that? What is it? I don't know. What was that? Relax, boys. It's probably just a phantom messing around. Come, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon. Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tab I thought I had to continue for another 2 years. What's that supposed to mean? Let's just say I don't think I see me wasting my time in Charms class next year. Amused, Blaise? Let's see just who's laughing in the end. You two go on. Wanna check something. Where's Harry? He's probably on the platform. Come on. Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus! Oh yeah... She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. That's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London. Ennervate! Hello, Harry! Luna. How'd you know where I was? Wrapspurts, your head's full of them. Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna. That's alright. It was like being with a friend. Well, I am your friend, Luna. That's nice. Oh, about time. I've been looking all over for you two. Right... Names? Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years. No exceptions, Potter. Who are those people? Aurors. Security. What's this cane here then? It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick. And what exactly will you be doing with all... be construed as an offensive weapon. It's alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. Nice face, Potter. Would you like me to fix it for you? Personally, I think you look a bit more... devil may care this way but... It's up to you. Well, have you ever fixed a nose before? No, but I've done several toes... How different are they really? Um, okay, yeah. Give it a go. Episkey! How do I look? Exceptionally ordinary. Brilliant! Hermione... I'm here in a minute. Will you stop eating? Your best friend is missing. Why won't you turn around, you lunatic? He's covered in blood again. Why is it he's always covered in blood? Looks like it's his own this time. Where have you been? What happened to your face? Later. What did I miss? The Sorting Hat says we ought to be brave and strong in these trouble times. Easy for it to say, though. It's a hat, isn't it? Very best of evenings to you all. Thanks. First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff. Horace Slughorn. Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post... as Potions Master. Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts... will be taken by Professor Snape. As you know, each and every one of you were searched upon your arrival here tonight. And you have the right to know why. Once, there was a young man. Like you, sat in this very hall. Walked this castle's corridors. Slept under it's roof. You see, to all the world, a student like any other. His name: Tom Riddle. Today of course, is known all over the world by another name. Which is why as I stand, looking out upon you all tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact. Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps... dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. But in the end, that greatest weapon... is you. Just something to think about. Now off to bed, beep beep. That was cheerful. History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down. Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis, that is the girls' lavatory. Potter. Oh, this can't be good. Enjoying ourselves, are we? I had a free period this morning, Professor. So I noticed. I would think you would want to fill it with Potions. Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror? Well, it was, but I was told to have to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn's perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with "Exceeds Expectations". Brilliant, um... Well, I'll head there straight away. Oh, good, good. Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there. I don't want to take Potions. There's Quidditch trials coming up, I need to practice. Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all plan. Harry, my boy, I've been beginning to worry. You brought someone with us, I see. Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions. A menace, actually so. I'm probably just gonna-- Nonsense, we'll sort you out. Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out. I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet and nor is Ron. Not to worry, get what you want from the cupboard. Now as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...? Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum. And that one-- It's terribly tricky to make. This is Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world. It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them. For example, I smell... Freshly mown grass and new parchment and... Spearmint toothpaste. Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible, but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one. Oh yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion, known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly known referred to as-- Liquid luck. Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck. Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. One sip and you'll find that all of your endeavours succeed. At least until the effects wear off. So this is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead. Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. Issue one doubt, however. Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all. Let the brewing commence. How did you do that? You crush it, don't cut it. No, the instructions specifically says to cut. No, really. Merlin's beard! It is perfect! So perfect I'd just say one drop would kill us all! Here we are then, as promised. One vial of Felix Felicis. Congratulations. Use it well. Oh Harry, you got my message? Come in. How are you? I'm fine, sir. Enjoying your classes? I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you. I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. Do you? Definitely. What about your activities outside the classroom? Sir? Well, I notice you've spent a great deal of time with Miss Granger. I can't help wondering if-- Oh, no, no, I mean... She's brilliant and we're friends. But no. Forgive me. I was only being curious. But enough chit-chat. You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here. What you're looking at are memories. In this case, pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known, then: Tom Riddle. This vial contains the most sufficient memory. On the day I first met him. I'd like you to see it. If you want. I'm to admit to some confusion for receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. There have been incidents with the other children-- Nasty things. Tom, you have a visitor. How'd you do, Tom? Don't. You're the doctor, aren't you? No, I'm a professor. I don't believe you. She wants me looked at. They think I'm... different. Or perhaps they're right. I'm not mad. Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. Hogwarts is a school. School of magic. You can do things, can't you, Tom? Things other children can't. I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who mean to me. Can make them hurt. If I want. Who are you? Well, I'm like you, Tom. I'm different. Prove it. I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom. Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom. At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it. You understand me? I can speak to snakes too. They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal for someone like me? Did you know, sir, then? Did I know I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No. If I had, I... Over time while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess who that teacher might be? You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach potions, did you, sir? No, I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something that I desire very dearly. He will not give it out easily. You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect to me. I did. Do you want me to let him? Yes. Okay, so this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all for a few drills just to assess you straight. Quiet, please! Shut it! Thanks. Alright, um, now then, remember, just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? Good. No hard feelings, Weasley, alright? Hard feelings? Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper's, well, It's... nothing personal. Really? Such a big guy like you? You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think? Keepers need to be quick, agile. I'll have my chances. Say, um, you think you could introduce me to your friend, Granger? Wouldn't mind, eh, getting on a first-hand base, you know what I mean? Come on, come on. Go, Cormac. Come on, Ron! Come on, Ron. Confundus. He's brilliant. I have to admit I thought I was going to miss that last one. I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard. He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione-- Cormac. He's vile. Have you ever heard of the spell: Sectumsempra? No, I haven't. If you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in. Not bloody likely. He's top of the class. He's even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he's a genius. I'd like to know who's that book was. Let's have a look, shall we? No. Why not? The binding is fragile. "The binding is fragile"? Yeah. Who's the Half-Blood Prince? Who? That's what it says right here. This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince. For weeks, you carry around this book. Practically, sleep with it, and yet you have no desire to find out who the Half-Blood Prince is. I didn't say I wasn't curious and I don't sleep with it. Well, it's true. Well, I got a nice chat before I go to bed. And all you do is that bloody book. It's like being with Hermione. Well, I was curious So, I went to-- The library? The library? And? And nothing. I couldn't find a reference anywhere to the Half-Blood Prince. There we go. That settles it, then. Yeah, uh... hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks. Uh no, emergency choir practice from the freighthorse. Does anyone fancy a butterbeer? A chum of mine was sledging down Clagsby Hill. We had a very long, home-made Norwegian style sledge. We hurtled down, we hit what most... Ron, sit aside me. Okay. Something to drink? Three butterbeers and some ginger in mine, please. Oh, bloody hell. Ron, see they're only holding hands. And snogging. I'd like to leave. What? You can't be serious. That happens to be my sister. So? What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me? Would you expect her to get up and leave? Hey, my boy. So wonderful to see you. And you, and you. So what brings you here? Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back further than I care to admit. I could remember when it was One Broomstick. All hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days, I used to throw together the occassional supper party. Select a student or two. Would you be game? I consider it an honor, sir. You'd be welcome too, Granger. I'd be delighted, sir. Splendid! Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby. What are you playing at? Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him. Get to know him? Dunno. It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask. You got a little bit... Katie, we don't know what it could be. Harry, what... I know what I'm doing. Did you hear what she was saying back in the pub there on me and her snogging? I warned her. I warned her not to touch it. Don't get any closer! Get back, all of you. Oh no, no, no. Do not touch that, except for the wrappings. Do you understand? You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks? It's like I said. She left to go to the loo. And when she came back, she had the package. She said it was important that she deliver it. Did she say to whom? To Professor Dumbledore. Very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go. Why is it when something happens, it is always you three? Believe me, Professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years. Oh, Severus. What do you think? I think Ms. Bell is lucky to be alive. She was cursed, wasn't she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. If she was delivering that to Professor Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly. Yes, she was cursed. It was Malfoy. That is a very serious accusation, Potter. Indeed. Your evidence? I just know. You "just" know. Once again, you're astonished with your gifts, Potter. Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the Chosen One. I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you. What do you suppose Dean sees in her-- Ginny? And what does she see in him? Dean-- He's brilliant. You called him slick git not five hours ago. Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he? Something snaps. You've got to hate him, you know? Old principle. I suppose. So what do you think he sees in her? I don't know. She's smart, funny, attractive-- Attractive? You know, she's got nice skin. Skin? You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin? For blood, I mean. I'm just--I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor. Hermione's got nice skin. When you say it, as skin goes, I mean. I've never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. I think I'll be going to sleep now. Right. So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your uncle Tiberius these days? Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant to get hunting with him and the Minister of Magic over the holidays. Oh, well, be sure to give them both my best. And what about your uncle, Belby? For those of you who don't know well, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. Is he working on anything new? I don't know. He and my dad don't get along. 'Prolly cause my dad says potions are rubbish. His only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day. And what about you, Ms. Granger, what exactly does your family do in the Muggle world? My parents are dentists. They attend to people's teeth. Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession? No. Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich, did bite my father once. He needed ten stitches. Ah, Ms. Weasley. Come in, come in. Look, her eyes. They've been fighting again. Her and Dean. Sorry, I'm not usually late. No matter, just in time for dessert. That is if Belby has left you any. What? Nothing. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Potter! I'm sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass. Ah yes, most intriguing object. The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation. It is stimulating, the sand runs slowly. If it is not... I think I'll be going, then. Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy. Actually, some of your classmates... Well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf. Shelf, sir? Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry? Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn't you, sir? Tom Riddle? You were his teacher. Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers who was here at Hogwarts. What was he like? I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents. Of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy, committed to becoming a first-grade wizard. Not unlike others I've known. Not unlike yourself, in fact. If the monster existed, it was very deep within. You okay, Ron? I'm counting on you, Ron. I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya? Be good, Ron. Loser! What's he wearing? So how was it, then? How is what? Your dinner party? Pretty boring actually. But I think Harry enjoyed dessert. Slughorn's having Christmas, do you know? I'm about to bring someone. I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he? Actually, I was going to ask you. Really? Good luck today, Ron. I know you'll be brilliant. I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot. Are you alright? Juice? Sure. Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron. Is that why you put something in his cup? Is it a tonic? Liquid luck. Don't drink it, Ron. You could be expelled for that. What are we talking about? Come on, Harry, we've got a game to win. Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! You shouldn't have done it. I know. I supposed I could have just used the Confundus charm. That was different. That was try-outs, this was a natural game. You didn't put in? Ron only thought you did. Charm spell. Just practising. Very good. How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny? I know. I see the way you look at her. You're my best friend. Oops! I think this room's taken. What's with the birds? Oppugno. It feels like this. I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it. It's chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is I'm a free agent. He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really couldn't care less. Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together? Yes. Now, given the circumstances, I had to make other arrangements. Have you? Yes. Why? Well, I just thought seeing is not the risk at going with who we'd really like to, We should go together, as friends. Why didn't I think of that? Who are you going with? Um, it's a surprise. Anyways, you have got to worry about. You can't take anyone. You see that girl over there? That's Romilda Vane. Harry, she's been been trying to smuggle you a love potion. Really? Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One. But I am the Chosen One. Okay, sorry, um... Kidding. I'll ask someone I like. Someone cool. I've never been to this part of the castle. At least, not while awake. I sleep-walk, you see. That's why I wear shoes to bed. Harmonia nictere passus. Harmonia nictere passus. Harmonia nictere passus. Drink? Neville. I didn't get into the Slug Club. It's okay, though. He's got Melvin hanging up towels in the looroom. I'm--I'm fine, mate. Thanks. Okay. Hermione, what are you doing? What happened to you? No, I've just escaped. I mean, I left Cormac under the mistletoe. Cormac? That's who you invited? I thought it would annoy Ron the most. Thank you very much. We will catch up with you. He's got more tentacles than a Snargaluff plant. Dragon tails? No, I'm fine, thank you. Just this one. They give one horribly bad breath. On second thoughts, it might keep Cormac away. God, here he comes. I think she just went to paddle her nose. She's a little minx, your friend. Nice to work. How nasty isn't she? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is this I'm eating, by the way? Dragon balls. You've just brought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. Not so quick, Potter. Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date-- Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. Besides, I only wish to convey a message. Message? From Professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holidays. He... He's travelling. And he won't return until term resumes. Travelling where? How are you? Get your hands off me, you filthy Squibb. Professor Slughorn, sir. I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party. Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy? I'll escort him out. Certainly, Professor. Alright, everyone carry on, carry on. Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What about you? I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow. I don't need protection. I was chosen for this. I don't know what all this mean, but I won't fail him. You're afraid, Draco. You attempt to consider, but it's obvious, let me assist you. No. I was chosen. This is my moment. Unbreakable Vow. You sure that's what Snape said? Positive. Why? It's just, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. I-I worked that much out for myself, funny enough. I don't understand. Oh bloody hell. I miss you. Lovely. All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped, look. Then I'll take your word for it. So what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow? You die. Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? I know it sounds mad. Has it occured to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so he could find out what he was up to? Ginny! That's not what it sounded like. Perhaps Harry is right, Remus. I mean, to make an Unbreakable Vow-- It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore, I do. Dumbledore can make mistakes. He said so himself. You are blinded by hatred. I'm not. Yes, you are. People are disappearing, Harry. Daily. We could only place our trust in a handful of people. If we started fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed. Ginny! Open up, you. Don't you trust me? It's good. Just, uh, get... Pie? Not for me. No. You'll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll, his condition. Are you alright, Mr. Weasley? We're being followed, all of us. Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house. It's not been easy. Did you get my owl? Yes, I did. If Dumbledore is traveling, then perhaps news to the Ministry, but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy... I know a bit more. Go on. I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes. I think from what you described... What you and Ron saw at the end of summer, the object that Draco is so interested in, is a Vanishing Cabinet. A "Vanishing Cabinet"? They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can see the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come knocking, one simply have to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. It transports you practically anywhere. Tricky contraptions, though. Very temperamental. What happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes? Nothing. It's still there. It was delicious, Molly, really. Are you sure you won't stay? No, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst. Remus? Sweetheart. Has Ron gone to bed? Um, not yet. No. Shoelace... Merry Christmas, Harry. Merry Christmas. Harry, no! Harry! Remus. Ginny! I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black! You coming to get me? Get me! He's trying to get me! Harry? Stupefy! Harry! Ginny! Molly. It's so easy for them to get to you. You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realise who you are, Harry! I know who I am, Hermione, alright. Sorry. Hon, go somewhere. That's my Won-Won. Excuse me, I have to go and vomit. ...Always you ruin half the start. Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? And by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right. It is my favorite. But how did you know? Intuition. Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Look sharp, Tom. Don't be caught out of bed after hours. Is something on your mind, Tom? Yes, sir. See, I couldn�t think of anyone else to go to. The other professors... Well, they're not like you. They might misunderstand. Go on. I was in the library the other night. In the restricted section. And I picked something rather odd about this rare magic. I thought perhaps, you could illuminate me. It's called, as I understand it, Hor... I beg your pardon? I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Now get out of here at once and don't let me ever catch you mentioning them again! Confused? I'd be surprised if you weren't. I don't understand. What happened? This is perhaps the most important memory I had collected. It is also a lie. This memory has been tempered with by the same person whose memory it is. Our old friend, Professor Slughorn. But why would he temper with his own memory? I suspect he's ashamed of it. Why? Why, indeed. I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you had done so. Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way you can. I don't know him that well, sir. This memory is everything. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must not fail. I highly recommend, reacquaint yourself with the chapter on antidotes. Now, I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go. Elise, don't forget your rat tail. Aha! It isn't the Prince of Potions himself! What do I owe this pleasure? Oh, sir, I wondered if I wanted to ask you something. Ask away, dear boy. Ask away. Well, you see the other day, I was in the library in the restricted section, and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic. Yes, what was this rare piece of magic? Well, I don't know, but I can't remember the name exactly. But it just got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us? I'm Potions Master, Harry, I think your question better be posed to Professor Snape. Yes, he and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is... Well, he's not like you. He might misunderstand. Yes, it would be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic, myself I always strive to live within the light. I suggest you do the same. Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir, when he came asking questions? Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he? Didn't he? Yes? Oh, it's you, Potter. I-I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment. That's beautiful, isn't it? The moon. Divine. Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we? It was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one. Or twenty? I can't stop thinking about her, Harry. Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you. She could never annoy me. I think I love her. Well, brilliant. Do you think she knows I exist? I very well hope so. She's been snogging you for three months. Snogging? Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane. Okay, very funny. What was that for? It's no joke. I'm in love with her! Alright, fine. You're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her? No. Can you introduce me? Come on, Ron. I will introduce you to Romilda Vane. I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential. Where's Romilda? What's the matter with Wimby? Very powerful love potion. Very well, better bring him in. I always thought you could whip up a remedy for this is in no time, Harry. Well, I-I thought this called for more practised hands, sir. Hello, darling. Fancy a drink? Perhaps, you're right. I'm sorry, by the way, Professor, about earlier today. Our misunderstanding. Oh, not at all. Old water under the bridge, you know. Correct? Well, I expect you're tired a bit, after all these years. And the questions about Voldemort. Don't use that name! Here you go, boy. Bottom's up. What's this? Tonic for the nerves. What happened to me? A love potion. A bloody strong one at there. I feel really bad. You need to pick me up, my boy. Got butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances. Here you are, Potter. To life! Ron! Ron! Professor, do something. I-I don't understand! Come on, Ron, breathe! These girls... They're gonna kill me. Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar. You should be very proud of your student, Horace. Ah, yes. Very proud. I think we agree Potter's actions were heroic. The question is: Why were they necessary? I, indeed. This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don't remember who gave you this bottle? By the way, it possesses remarkably subtle hints of liquorice and cherry. When not polluted with poison. Actually, I had intended to give it as a gift, myself. To whom, might I ask? To you, headmaster. Where is he? Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me? What's she doing here? I might ask you the same question. I happen to be his girlfriend. And I happen to be his... friend. Don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks. I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting. He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I've always found him interesting. See? He senses my presence. Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here. I'm here. Hermione. Hermione. Hermione. Oh to be young and to feel love's keen sting. Well, come over, everybody. Mr. Weasley's well attended. About time, don't you think? Thank you. Just shut up. Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow. Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again. Well, she came to visit you in the hospital. And you talked. I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation. Don't get me wrong. I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's. She seems a bit... put out. Yes, um... She does, isn't she? You say you don't remember anything from that night. Anything at all? There is something. It can't be. I was completely boggled, didn't I? Boggled. Harry... That's Katie. Katie Bell. Katie, how are you? I know you're going to ask, Harry. But I don't know who cursed me. I've been trying to remember. Honestly. But I just can't. Katie. I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed it, didn't you? Sectumsempra! You have to get rid of it. Today. Take my hand. It's the Room of Requirement. We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. Where no one'll ever find it. Including you. What was that? What was that? See, you never know what you'll find up here. Alright, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted. Close your eyes. S u B: V e R d i K That can stay hidden up here too if you like. So, did you and Ginny do it then? What? Well, hide the book? Oh, yeah. Oh, g-- Still no luck with Slughorn then, I take it? Luck. That's it. All I need is a bit of luck. Well, how do you feel? Excellent. Really excellent. Remember, Slughorn usually leaves early, takes a walk, and then returns to his office. Right. I'm going down to Hagrid's. What? No, Harry, you've got to go to speak to Slughorn. We have a plan. I know but I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. I feel it's--it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean? No. No. Well, trust me. I know what I'm doing. Or Felix does. Hi! Merlin's beard, Harry! Sorry, sir. I should have announced myself. Clear my throat. Coughed. You probably thought I was Professor Sprout? Definitely. What makes you think? Ah well, just your general behaviour, sir. Just sneaking around, jumping when you saw me. Are those tentacular leaves, sir? Yes. They're very valuable, aren't they? Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer. Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions but one does hear rumours. My only interests are purely academical. I mean, personally, these plants always kinda freak me out. Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry? Through the front door, sir. I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very dear friend and I just fancy paying him a visit. So if you don't mind, I will be going now. Harry! Sir? It's nearly nightfall. Surely, you realise I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself. Well then, by all means, come along, sir. Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately! That would be counterproductive, sir. And what makes you say that? No idea. Horace. Merlin's beard! Is that an actual Acromantula? A dead one, I think, sir. Good God. Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it? "Kill it"? My oldest friend, he was. I'm so sorry, I didn't-- Ah, don't worry yourself. You're not alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. The eyes I reckon, they unnerve some folk. Not to mention the pincers. Yeah, I reckon that too. Hagrid... The last thing I wish to be is indelicate but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare. Would you allow me to extract a vial or two, purely for academic purposes, you understand? Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him much good now is it. My thoughts exactly. I have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occassions as this. Old... Potion master's habit, you know? I wish you could have seen him with his prime. Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent. Would you like me to say a few words? Yes. Had a family, I trust? Oh, yeah. Farewell... Aragog. Farewell, Aragog. King of the arachnids. Your body will decay... but your spirit lingers on and your human friends find solace, the loss they have sustained. # Laid to rest, # # And his wand, snapped in two, # # Which was sad, # I had him from an egg, you know? Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. No bigger than a Pekingese. A Pekingese, mind you. How sweet! I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me. One afternoon, I came downstairs and... it vanished. Poof. That's very odd, isn't it? Yes, doesn't it? But that's life! I suppose, you--you go along with and suddenly... poof. Poof. Poof. It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon, I discovered the bowl on my desk... With just a few inches of clear water in it... And floating on the surface was a flower petal. As I watched, it sank. But just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic. Wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily. Your mother. The day I came downstairs, day's the bowl was empty. That's the day your mother... I know why you're here. But I can't help you. It would ruin me. Do you know why I survived, Professor? The night I got this? Because of her, because she sacrificed herself... Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. Don't say his name. I'm not afraid of the name, Professor. I'm going to tell you something. Something others have only guessed at. It's true. I am the Chosen One. Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office and I need to know what you told him. Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise, you disgrace her. Otherwise, she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty. Forever. Please, don't think badly of me when you say it. I had no idea what he was like, even then. I was in the library the other day. In the restricted section... and I read something rather odd about this rare magic. It's called, as I understand it, a Horcrux. I beg your pardon? Horcrux. I came across the term while reading... and I didn't fully understand it. I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. Very dark, indeed. Which is... why I came to you. A horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. But I don't understand how that works, sir. One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed. Protected? That part of your soul which is hidden lives on. In other words, you cannot die. And how does one splits his soul, sir? I think you already know the answer to that, Tom. Murder. Yes, killing rips the soul apart and it is a violation against nature. Can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven-- Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? To rip the soul in seven pieces! This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic? Of course, sir. It'll be our little secret. Sir. This is beyond anything I imagined. Do you mean, sir, he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux? Oh yes, he succeeded, alright. And not just once. What are they exactly? It could be anything. Most common place of objects. A ring, for example, or a book. Tom Riddle's diary. It's a horcrux, yes. Four years ago when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this. I knew then, this was a different kind of magic. Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful... And the ring? Belonged to Voldemort's mother. Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux-- One destroys Voldemort. How would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they? True, but magic, especially dark magic... leaves traces. It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? When you leave the school. Yes, and I think perhaps, I may have found another. But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry. Have you ever considered that you ask too much, that you take too much for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore? Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant. I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss. Oh, Harry... You need a shave, my friend. You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown. At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I'm an old man. You still look the same to me, sir. Just like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid. The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous. I promise you for the company of me and I stand by that promise. But there's one condition. You must obey every command I give you without question. Yes, sir. You do understand what I'm saying. Should I tell you to hide, you hide. Should I tell you to run, you run. Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so. Your word, Harry. My word. Take my arm. Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts. Well, being me has its privileges. This is the place. Oh, yes. This place has known magic. Sir. In order to gain passage, payment must be made. Payment intended to weaken any intruder. You should have let me, sir. No, no, Harry. Your blood's much more precious than mine. Voldemort would not have made it easy to discover his hiding place. He would put certain defenses in position. Careful. There it is. The only question is how do we get there? If you would, Harry. Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? Oh, yes. It has to be drunk. All of it has to be drunk. You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me. I may risk to get what I'm here. I'd cause me so much pain that I'd beg for relief. You are not to indulge these requests. It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion. Even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood? Why can't I drink it, sir? Because I'm much older, much cleverer and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry. Professor. Professor! Professor. Can you hear me? Professor! You have to keep drinking like you said, remember? Stop. I will stop. I will stop. But only-- only if you keep drinking. Don't make me-- Kill me. I'm sorry, sir. Kill me! All my fault. My fault. Just one more, sir. One more, I promise. I promise I'll do what you say. No, no. I promise! Please! Harry. Water. Water. Water. Look, you did it, sir. Look. Harry... water. Aguamenti! Water. Lumos. Lumos maxima! Stupefy! Stupefy! Sectumsempra! Harry... Incarcerous! Stupefy! Harry... Harry... Partis Temporus! Go to your houses! No toddling! We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir. To Madam Pomfrey. No... Severus, Severus is awakening. Wake him. Tell him what happened. Speak to no one else. Severus, Harry. Hide yourself below, Harry. Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission. Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below. Harry, do as I say. Trust me. Trust me. Good evening, Draco. What brings you here on this fine spring evening? Who else is here? I heard you talking. I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful. Have you always been to yourself, Draco? Draco, you are no assassin. How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you. Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she would bear a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one lace with poison. Forgive me, Draco, I cannot help feel these actions are so weak that your... heart can't really have been in. He trusts me. I was chosen. I shall make it easy for you. Expelliarmus! Very good. Very good. You're not alone. There are others. How? The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. I've been mending it. Let me guess, it has a sister. A twin. In Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage. Ingenious. Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you. I don't want your help. Don't you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you. Or he's gonna kill me. Oh, look what we have here. Well done, Draco. Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions aren't over, don't you? Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of tight schedule. Do it! He doesn't have the stomach. Just like his father. Let me finish him in my own way. No, the Dark Lord was clear the boy has to do it. This is your moment, Draco. Do it! Go on, Draco, now! No. Severus. Please... Avada Kedavra. Hagrid! Snape, he trusted you! Go on! Incarcerous! Fight back, you coward! Fight back! No, he belongs to the Dark Lord. Sectumsempra! You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? Yes, I'm the Half-Blood Prince. Potter... Enlighten what has happened. If you should have the need to talk to someone... You should know... Professor Dumbledore... You meant a great deal to him. Do you think he would have done it? Draco. No. No, he was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. I did nothing. It was fake. Open it. To the Dark Lord: I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B. R.A.B.? Don't know. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. It means it was all a waste. All of it. Ron's okay with you, you know. You and Ginny. If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum. I'm not coming back, Hermione. I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. And I don't know where that'll leave me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can. I've always admired your courage, Harry. But sometimes, you can be really thick. You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry. I never realised how beautiful this place was.
These are dark time
there is no denying.
Our world has prehaps faced no greater
threat than it does today.
But I say this to our citizens.
We, ever your servants ...
... Will continue to defend you liberty
and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.
Your ministry remains strong.

HARRY POTTER AND
THE DEATHLY HALLOWS / i
Severus, I was beginning to worry
you'd lost your way...
...Come, we have saved you a seat
- You bring news, I trust
- It will happen next Saturday.
At nightfall
I've heard differently
my lord.
Dawlish, the auror has let slip
that the Potter boy will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17
This is a false trail
The auror office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him think
that we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that right., didn't they ?
What say you , Pius?
One hears many things
my lord.
But whether the truth is
among them, is not clear.
Spoken like a true politican.
you will I think
prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he be taken the boy?
- To a safe house.
Most likely the home
of someone in the Order.
I'm told its been given protection
of every manner possible
Once there it will be
impractical to attack him
My lord, I'd like to
volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy
Wormtail
Have i not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet ?
Yes, my lord.
Right away, my lord.
As inspiring as I find
your bloodlust, Bellatrix ...
... I must be the one
to kill Harry Potter.
But I face an
unfortunate complication.
My wand and the Potters
share the same core.
They are, someways, twins.
We can wound but not
fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him ...
... must do it with
anothers wand
Well, surely one of you
would like the honor
What about you, Lucius?
- My lord?
- "My Lord"?
I require your wand.
- Do I detect elm?
- Yes, my Lord.
And the core?
- Dragon heartstring my lord
- Dragon heartstringt?
To those of you who do not know ...
...we are joined here tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage ...
... who until recently taught
at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry
Her speciality was muggle studies
It is Miss Burbage's belief that
Muggles are not so different. than us
She would given her way ...
... have us mate with them.
To her the mixture of magical and
Muggle blood is not an abomination ...
... but something,
to be encouraged.
Severus.
Severus, please.
We're friends.
Nagini.
Dinner.
- Hello Harry!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- You're looking fit.
Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...
Lets say we get undercover,
before someone blows you..
Do you?
Kingsley, weren't you looking
after the PrimeMinister?
You are more important.
- Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- He wasn't always so handsome
- Daredevil.
- True enough
Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback
I Would like to return the favour one day
You're still beautiful to me, Billy.
Just remember, Fleur
Bill takes his steak on the raw side now
My husband the joker.
By the way,
Wait till you hear the news....
Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.
We have to get the hell out of here.
Potter, you are underage, which means
you've still got the trace on you.
What is the trace?
If you sneezed, the Ministry
will know who wiped your nose.
The point is that we have to use those modes,
of transport which the trace can't detect
Brooms, thestrals and like
We'll go in pairs.
That way if anything is out there waiting
for us...I reckon there will be
... they won't know which
Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one ?
I do believe you are fully
aware of this particular brew
- No, absolutely not.
- I told you he won't take it well.
No, if you think that I'll let,
everyone risk their lives for me ...
- Have done if before, haven't we.
- No, no, this is different.
Taking that becoming me.
No!
Well none of us really
fancy it mate
Yes, imagine if something went wrong,
and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They all agreed to take the risk.
Technically I'd been coerced
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.
Nip it, Mundungus.
- Alright Granger its discussed
- Blimey, Hermione!
Put it in there, please.
For those of you who haven't taken
polyjuice potion before, fair warning.
Tastes like goblin piss
Have enough of that
experience do you Mad-eye?
Just trying to defuse the
tension.
- Wow! we are identical!
- Not yet you are not.
- Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?
- Yeah I don't really fancy this color.
Well fancy this , you are not you
so shove it up and strip
Alright, Alright
You too, Potter.
Bill, look away, I'm hideous.
- Ginny did lie about that tattoo.
- Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.
Well,we will be pairing off.
Everyone will have a protector.
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I want to keep an eye on you
- As for Harry ...
- Yes?
The real Harry.
Where the devil are you anyway?
- Here.
- You ride with Hagrid.
I brough you here 16 years ago,
when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.
Seems only right that
I should be the one that takes you away.
Yes this is all very touching.
Lets go !
Head for the Burrow.
We rendezvous you there.
- On the count of three!
- Hold tight, Harry!
One!
Two!
Three!
Help!
- Hagrid, we have to help the others!
- We can't do that, Harry
Mad-Eye's orders.
Hang on!
Stupefy! / i
Hang on, Harry!
Hagrid!
No! No!
Harry!
Hagrid! Hagrid!
What happened?
Where are the others?
Is noone else back?
They were on to us
way from the start, Molly.
We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness
you two are allright
Death Eaters were waiting
for us. Attacked us.
George and Ron
should have been back.
A dad with Fred too.
Here.
Quick.
Into the house.
Oh My boy ...
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
What creature sat in the corner the first time when
Harry Potter visited of my office in Hogwarts.
- Are you mad?
- What creature?
A Grindylow.
We have been betrayed .
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.
I had to make sure,
you were not an imposter.
Wait!
The last words Albus Dumbledore,
spoke to the pair of us.
"Harry is the best hope we have."
"Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig i think.
She was trying to protect me.
Thanks.
He deserves that. Brilliant he was.
I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him.
Really?
Why is it always so suprising?
We are the last back?.
Where's George?
How are you feeling, Georgie?
- Saintlike.
- Come again?
Saintlike.
Im holey. I'm holey fred
Get it?
A whole wide world of ear related
humour and you go for holey.
Pathetic.
I'm still better looking than you.
Mad-Eye is dead.
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and disapparated.

Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going to die.
Not for me.
Because of you?
You think Mad-Eye died
for you?
Think George
took that curse for you?
You maybe the chosen one, mate ...
... but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
Its always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- And leave Hermione?
Are you mad.
We won't last two days.
without her
Do not tell her
I said that.
Besides you still have the trace on you,
you still got the wedding ...
... the wedding ...
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.
They are our only chance,
to beat him.
And the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.
Try and understand me
You will only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean they are bits of his soul,
the Horcruxes.
Pieces of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...
... and you destroyed
Tom Riddle's Diary.
He must have felt something?.
To kill thei other Horcruxes,
we have to find them?.
Where are they?
Where do we start?

inspite of whats going on
Morning.
All together now!
One! Two! Three!
How it it going?
Great.
Well, hell.
What is the Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.
Herein is is said forth
...?
the last will and testament of ...
... Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to
Ronald Billius Weasley ... "
"... I leave my delumintor."
"A device, of my own making ..."
"... In hope when things
seem most dark ... "
"... it will show you the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yes.
Really.
What is it?
Super.
" To Hermione Jean Granger ..."
"... I leave my copy of
Tales of Beedle the Bard / i ..."
"... In the hope that she finds it
entertaining and instructive "
Mom used to tell me those.
The wizard and the hopping pot,
Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump ...
Come on.
Babbity Rabbity...
No?
"To Harry James Potter ..."
"... I leave the snitch he caught
in his first match at Hogwarts... "
"... As a reminder of
rewards of perseverance ... "
"... And skill."
Is that it then?
Not quite.
Dumbledore left you ...
... a second bequest
The sword of
Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important
historical artifact it belongs ...
to Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he most
needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself to
any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...
... but that does not make it
that wizards property
Unfortunately the current
whereabout of the sword are unknown.
Excuse me?
The Sword is Missing.
I don't know what you are up,
to, Mr. Potter ...
... but you can't fight
this war on your own
He is too strong.
Hello, Harry.
i've interrupted
deep thoughts, haven't I?
I see a growing
in your eyes
Of course not.
How are you, Luna?
Very well, The garden
gnome has bitten my finger...
Gnome saliva is s very benificial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know
Mr. Potter ...
... we at the Quibbler, disagree with Daily Prophet,
and have always fully supported Dumbledore ...
... during his lifetime and after his death,
and we also support you.
Thank you.
Come Daddy.
Harry does not want to talk to us right now?.
He is just too polite
to point it out.
Harry Potter ...
Excuse me, sir.
- May I sit down?
- Mr. Potter.
By all means...here
I found what you wrote
in the Daily Prophet.
really moving.
You obviously knew
Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly
knew him the longest.
Unless we count his brother Aberforth,
and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.
I didn't even know
he had a brother.
Ah Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.
Do not despair, Elphias.
I'm told he has been thoroughly
unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.
in 800 pages.
Word has it
that someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the
Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know
who that is , Elphias.
Monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
- Oh, boy ...
... she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.
She was as close to Dumbledore
as anyone
Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well
worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...
... to take a peek into
that old birds records.
Godris Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Thats where she first met Dumbledore.
You don't say thar he lived there too.
His family moved
there ...
... after his father killed
those three Muggles.
It was a quite the scandal.
Honestly my boy ...
... are you sure
that you knew him at all?
Ministry has fallen. / i
Minister of Magic is dead. / i
They are coming. / i
They are coming. / i
Nice meeting you,
Mr. Potter.
Ginny!
Go! Go!
Where are we?
Shaftesbury Avenue.
I used to come up here to theaters
with mom and dad.
I do not know why I though of it. It was
the first thing to come to my head
This way.
Have you ever seen this before?
Kreacher?
- It is Master Regulus's locket!
- There were two, weren't there?
Where is the other one?
Kreacher deosn't know
about the other locket.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
It was in this house.
Flithy mudblood...bloodtraitor Weasley!
Answer her.
Yes It was here, in this house.
Most evil object.
- What do you mean?
- Before Master. Regulus died ...
... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things
including the locket.
Who?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
My father will hear about this.
Hey loosers.
He isn't here.

MAGIC IS MIGHT / i
- Therefore beginning today ...
... each employee will submit
themselves... to evaluation
.
But know this, that you
have nothing to fear...
... if you have nothing to hide.
They have flesh memories.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought, that it might open at to your touch.
Dumbledore could have
hidden something inside it.
- Harry Potter!
- Zlezte of me!
Expelliarmus / i
What are you playing at?
Setting a pair of bleeding
elf on me?
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley ...
... which Dobby thought was curious and then
Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
And then Dobby saw Kreacher
talking with the thief.
Me a thief ?
You foul little ...
- You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.
- Mr. Weasley.
- So good to see you.
- Nice shoes.
Listen.
I panicked, alright?
He was right on me and
Mad-Eye fell off his broom
- You ...
- Tell the truth.
When you turned this place over, don't deny it
You found a locket am I right?
Boy, was it valuable?
Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?
There I was selling my goods ...
... when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see my license.
she says
she would lock me up?.
Would have done too if she
didn't take a fancy to that locket.
Who was it?
The witch, do you know her?
No ...
Oh ! She's there.
Look.
Its that old hag
MINISTRY SEEKS
EDUCATIONAL REFORM / i
Right
Remember what we said.
Don't speak to anybody,
Unless it is absolutely necessary.
Just ...
Try and act normal.
Do what everybody
else is doing.
Do that and with a bit of luck
we'll get inside.
- And then ...
- It gets really tricky.
Right.
- This is completely mental.
- "Completely ?"
The world is mental.
Come on.
We have a Horcrux to find.
We have to flush
ourselves in.
Its bloody Disgusting.
- Are those ...?
- Muggles.
In there ... rightful place.
Let me tell you
stop to freak out a bit.
How long did you say
this polyjuice potion will last, Hermione?
I didn't.
Cattermole.
Its still raining inside my
office. Its been two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You realize i'm going downstairs
don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now if my wife's
blood status were in doubt ...
... and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement
needed a job doing ...
... I think I might just
make that a priority
You have one hour.
Oh my god,
what am I gonna do?
My wife is all alone
downstairs.
Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh right.
- Level 2
- How do I stop it raining
- Try Finite Incantatem. / I
This is you, Ron.
Finite Incantatem. / i
Okay.
And if it doesn't work?
I say if don't locate Umbridge within the hour,
we find Ron and come back another day.
- Deal?
- Yes.
Ah, Mafalda
Trevor sent you, did he?
Good.
We'll go straight down.

Runcorn?
Morning.

Blimey!
I forgot what you look like.
- Where is Hermione?
- She's gone down to the court rooms, with Umbridge.
I am half blood.
My father was a wizard.
He worked there 30 years.
Perhaps you know him.
He Always wore a jacket or vice versa.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole,
- Yes.
- It's here.
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred;
Wife to Reginald?
Regi.
Thank you, Albert.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole.
Yes?
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry Mrs Cattermole
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court,
from witch or wizard you took this wand ?
No one.
I bought it in Diagon Alley,
by Ollivanders, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You are lying. Wands choose only witches,
and you're not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg, tell them I am.
What on Earth are you doing, Albert?
You are lying, Dolores.
One must not tell lies.
Stupefy! / i
- It's Harry Potter!
- It is him. Its okay to tell the kids.
Expecto patronum! / i
Mary.
Go on home.
Take the kids
I'll meet you there.

Hermione, his arm.
I know just do it!

This is gonna Sting a little bit
What happened? I thought we
were going to go back to Grimmauld Place.
We were.
Alright, One more, One more
We were there we were there but,
Yaxley got a hold of me ...
... and he saw
where we went ...
... We couldn't stay there,
so I brought us here, but ...
... Ron splinched.
It's good.
Protego Totalum. / i
- Salvia Hexi. / i
- What are you doing?
Protective enchantments.
I do not want a repeat of what happened at
Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?
-Get going with a tent
- Tent?
- Protego Totalum. / i
- Where am I supposed to find a tent?
Repello Mukletum.

What are you doing?
We have to keep it safe,
until we find out how to destroy it.
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sent you out to find those Horcruxes
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them
Doesn't it bother you?
You know the spell, Harry. / i
- Tell me, Gregorovitch.
- He stole it from me.
Who was it?
The thief?
The boy.
It was he who took it.
I never saw it again
I swear on my life.
I believe you.
Avada Kedavra! / i
I thought
it stopped.
You can't keep
, Harry.
- You-Know- Who found Gregorovitch.
- This Wand Maker?
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.
I do not know what.
But he wants it desperately.
As if his life depended on it
.
Don't, its his comfort zone.
??
It sets my teeth on edge,,
Whats he expecting to hear?? Good news?
One can only hope
not to hear bad news.
How long before he can travel?
- I'm doing everyting I can.
-You are not doing enough?
Take it off!
I said,
Take it off, now!
- Better?
- Right .
We will take in turns, okay?
What is that?
Snatchers.
Good to know,
that your enchantments work.
He could smell it.
my perfume.
I told you
Ron is not strong enough to apparate.
So we will go on foot then.
Only next time, even when I like
your perfume, do not use it.
The names of missing...
. / i
These are confirmed. / i
Oh, thank you.
He doesn't know what he is doing? does he?
None of us do.
- Oh My God !
- What?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
- You can tell me now?
Sword of Gryffindor .
Its goblin made
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and dust
have no effect on the blade.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger.
Okay ...
we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?
- Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
- With a basilisk.fang
If you tell me you got ,
one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...
Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets
you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor
Its blade is impregnated with
basilisk venom.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger
- Exactly, which is why
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
Thats why Dumbledore
left it to you in his will.
You're brilliant, Hermione.
Truely.
Actually, I just highly logical thinking,
which allows to me see past and irrelevant details ...
... and perceived cleary which
others overlook
Yeah, there is only one problem.
Someone stole the sword.
Hey, I'm still here.
You two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.
I told you everything
that Dumbledore told me!
Incase you haven't noticed
We have found one Horcrux already.
Yes, and we are as close to getting rid
of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?
Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...
you wouldn't have spoken like this
if you hadn't wore it all day
You know, why I listen to the radio every night?
To make sure that i don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or moms ...
You think i don't know that ?
- You think i don't know how it feels?
- You don't know how it feels!
Your parents are dead!
You have no family!
- Stop! Stop!
- Let me Go!
- Go Then
Ron ...
And you?
Are you coming or
are you staying?
Fine. I get it.
I saw you two the other night.
Ron's ...
There is nothing.
Ron!
Ron, where are you going?
Come back, now!
Salvia Hexi
I opens at the close / i
Hermione?
Hermione?
You were right.
Snithced have flesh memory ...
... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.
I almost swallowed it.
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?
I don't know.
I found something as well
At first I thought it was an eye
it's eye, but now I don't think it is.
And it's no rune,
it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.
Someone wrote it there.
Somebody inked it in
it isn't part of the book
Luna's dad was wearing that at
the wedding of Bill and Fleur.
Why would someone draw
it in a childrens book?
Hermione, I've been thinking
I want to go to Godric's Hollow
Its where I was born ,
Its where my parents died.
Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go
it means something to you
But it means something to
him too, Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost died there.
Isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
It is dangerous, Harry.
But I admit it recently I've been thinking
we have to go there
I think its is possible that
something else is hidden there.
What?
The Sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...
... what better place to hide it
than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor
Hermione ...
Don't tell me I have to give
you a haircut again
I still think that we
should use Polyjuice Potion.
No.
This is where I was born.
I don't want to return?,
as someone else.
Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.
Listen.
Do you think they are here, Hermione?
My mom and dad.
I think so.
Ignotus Peverell.
Hey, Harry?
Merry Christmas, Hermione.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Harry, someone is watching us.
Near the church.
I think I know who it is.
- I don't know this, Harry.
- Hermione, Dumbledore knew.
She might have the sword.
This is where they died, Hermione.
This is where he murdered them.
Bathilda, aren't you ?
Leave it, let me do that.
Miss Bagshot,
Who is this man?
Harry!
Are you feeling better?
This time can be overcome,
Hermione.
Forest of Dean.
I came here once with my mother and father.
Years ago.
Its just
how I remember it.
Trees, the river, everything.
Like nothings changed.
This of course is true,
everything has changed.
If there were my parents,
they would have nothing nepamtali.
Or trees.
Or river.
Not even me.
Perhaps we should
stay here, Harry.
Grow old?.
You wanted to know
Who was the boy in the photograph was.
I know.
Gellert Grindelwald.
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
Speaking of which
where's my wand?
Where's my wand, Hermione?
As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.
and it rebounded
I'm sorry.
I tried to mend it,
But wands are different.
Its nothing.
Lend me yours.
Go inside and get warm.
I'll take the locket as well.
Lumos. / i
Accio sword! / i
Diffindo. / i
Hermione?
Are you mental?
Ron, is that you?
Yes.
Didn't hurt yourself did you ?
- You cast the doe as well did you?
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.
Clear.
Okay, Ron.
Do it.
I can not. The thing affect me more
as you and Hermione.
- All the more reason
- I can not.
then why are you here?
Why did you come back?
I'll have to speak to it to open it
When it does, don't hesitate.
I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.
The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.
One.
Two.
Three.
and I see your heart and it is mine. / i
I see your dreams,
Ronald Weasley. / I
I see your fear. / i

Not My Favorites girl? om,

Ron!

Who would choose you .../ i
... compared to Harry Potter? / i
What are you compared to the chosen one? / i
Ron, its lying!
Your mother confessed,
she would prefer as a son. / i
What woman would take you? / i

Nothing...Nothing / I
Nothing compared to him. / i
Just think
There are only three to go.
Hermione?
Hermione?
Is everything alright?
Fine...
Actually its more than fine.
Hi.
You ...
... a complete arse of,
a Weasley!
You show up here after weeks
and you say 'hey'?
Where's my wand, Harry?
- Where is my wand?
- I don't know.
Harry Potter
You give me my wand!
-What happened to your wand?
- Nevermind he's got my wand.
What is that?
You destroyed it.
And how is it that you just happened to have the
sword of Gryffindor ?
It's a long story.
Don't think
it changes anything.
Of course not. I only destroyed a
bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.
I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.
-just didn't know how to find you
- how did you found us ?
With this. Doesn't just
Turn out lights
I don't know how it works
but christmas morning I sleping in this little pub ...
... keeping away from some snatchers.
- When I heard it.
- What?
Voice.
Your voice, Hermione.
comin out of it.
And what exactly did I say
if I may ask??
My name.
Just my name.
like a Whisper
So I took it, clicked it ...
... this tiny ball of light appeared
And I knew.
sure enough.
Flew towards me,
ball of light.
Right into my chest.
Straight through me.
Right here
I knew that it was gonna take me
where I needed to go
so I disapparated
came to this hillside
It was dark, I had
no idea where I was.
I just hoped
One of you will show yourself
you did
I have always liked these flames
Hermione makes.
How long do you think
she will stay mad at me?
i don't know ...
just keep talking about that little ball,
and it might touch her in the heart ...
... and she will come around.
- It's true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy.
But I think,thats why Dubledore left it to me
The delumintor.
I think somehow he knew
I'll need to find my way back
Hey, I just realized
you need a wand, don't yout?
I got one here.
Blackthorn 10 inches ,
nothing special.
- But be uploaded with just. - I took off
a snatcher few weeks ago
Don't tell hermione this
Definitely was a troll,
by the smell of it.
Engorgio. / i
Finite / i
We need to talk.
Yeah, alright
I want to go see
Xenophilius Lovegood.
Sorry?
See this ? It is a letter
Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.
Look at the signature.
It's the mark again
It keeps cropping up.
in The tales of Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...
it was there too.
- Where?
- Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.
- What dors it mean?
- Look...
You have no idea where the next Horcrux is
, and neither I do
But this,
this means something.
- I am sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood
Lets vote.
Those in favor.
are you still mad at him?
I am always mad at him
KEEP OFF THE
DIRIGIBLE PLUMS / i
Do not touch
Dirigible Plums.
What is it?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood.
I'm Harry Potter,
we met a few months ago.
Can we come in?
Where is Luna?
I don't know.
She will be along.
So...how can I
help you, Mr Potter ?
Well, actually ...
... it was about something that you were wearing
around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
- You mean this?
- Yes.
That's it exactly
What I wonder is ...
what is it?
What is it?
Well.. its the sign of
the deathly hallows ofcourse .
- The What?
- The What?
The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all
familiar with the tale of the three brothers?
- Yes.
- No.
I have it in here.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight
- Midnight.
Mom always said midnight.
Twilight is fine.
better actually.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight.
In time the brothers reached a
river too treacherous to pass
But they were learned in the magical arts
the three brothers simply waved their wands..
... and made a bridge.
Before they could cross however they
found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death
And he felt cheated
Cheated, because travelers
usually drowned in the river.
But Death was cunning.
he pretended to congratulate
the three brothers .on their magic..
... and said,
that each had earned a prize ...
... for being clever enough
to evade him
the oldest asked for a wand,
more powerful than any in existence
so death fashioned him a wand
from the elder tree that stood nearby
The second brother he decided
he wanted to humiliate death
even further..
... and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from
their graves
So Death picked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.
Finally, Death turned to
the third brother.
A humble man, asked for something
that allowed him to go from that place...
...without being followed
by death
And so it was that death reluctantly
handed over his own cloak of
invisibility
The first brother travelled
to a distant village...
... with the elder wand in his hand
he killed a wizard with whom he once had quarrels..
Drunk with the power that
the elder wand had given him..
... he bragged about it
You shall not prevail against his nose? ou.
But that night ...
...another wizard stole the wand
and slit the brothers throat for good measure.
And so the death took the first brother.
for his own
The second brother journeyed home,
where he took the stone and
turned it thrice in his hand
To his delight the girl he once
wanted to marry before her untimely death...
... appeared before him.
But soon she turned sad and cold
because she did not belong to the mortal world
Driven mad with hopeless longing
the second brother killed himself
so as to join her
And so death took the second brother
As for the third brother Death
searched for many years
but was never able to find him
only when he had attained a great age the
youngest brother shed the cloak of invisibilty
and gave it to his son ...
.. he then greeted death
as a old friend
and went with him gladly
departing this life as equals
so there we are
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry sir,
I still don't quite understand.
The Elder wand ...
... the most powerful wand
ever made.
The resurrection stone
The cloak of invisibility
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
Together they make one
master of death.
That mark was on the grave in
Godrics Hollow.
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell
family have something to do with
the deathly hallows
Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers
Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...
... and therefore inspiration for the story.
Your tea has gone cold
Don't go
I'll be right back?.
Let's get out of here .
I have more of this brndy pi? I will not.
- Thank you for ...
- You forgot the water.
- Water ?
- In the tea.
How silly of me.
You do not have to,
we should be going any way.
No, you do not!
Sir?
You are my only hope.
They were angry, you see,
because of what I've been writing.
so they took ...
... took my children.
my children
??
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
I got it!
treacherous little bleeder!
is there no one we can trust?
they kidnapped her
because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello beautiful.
Don;t just hang back
Snatch them
Harry.
Tell me. what to do Tell me, where it is. / I
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
-??
-??
I knew
that one day you come.
But surely as you know.
i no longer have what you seek.
I believe you Grindelwald,
tell me where it is
Tell me who posseses it.
The elder wand lies with him
ofcourse....
Buried in the earth.
with Dumbledore.
The hallows exist
He is only after one... the last one
He knows where it is.
he's gonna have it by the end of the night?.
you know who's had the elder wand.
Do not touch her!
Your boyfriend will get much worse for that
if he doesn't learn to behave himself
And what happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What is your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
Check it.
And you him and ugly, lovely?
What do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater
Half blood
There is no Vernon Dudley on here.
You hear that ugly?
This means you're lying to us.
- Why did not you tell us? Who you are?
- Do you have a mistake, I already told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We are not taking this lot to the Ministry.
Get Draco.
Well?
I can't be sure.
Look closely, son.
If we are the ones who
hand Potter to the Dark Lord....
... everything would be forgiven,
it would all be as it was understood ?
Now we won't be forgetting
who really caught him ...
...I hope Mr Malfoy.
- Don't dare to talk to me like that in my own house
- Lucius!
Do not be shy, come closer!
If this isn't who you
think it is Draco ...
... and we will call Him,
He'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure!
- Whats wrong with his face?
- Yes, what it wrong with his face?
We captured him like that.
Something he captured in the forrest I reckom
That happens during a stinging jinx
Was it you
Give me your wand, let's see
what your last spell was
And I? A.
Whats that?
Where did you get that from?
It was in her bag when we searched her
I reckon its mine now.
Are you mad?
Get out!...Get out!
Cissy ...

I'd like a conversation with this one...
... girl to girl!
What are we gonna do??
We can't leave Hermione alone with her!

The Sword is meant to be in my vault
How did you get it?
- Did you and your friend STEAL FROM MY VAULT?
-
I didn't take anything.
I do not believe you.

- There is no way out of here.
We tried everything.
It's enchanted

keep on yourself
Help us!

You don't know?
Please try again.
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it?
Who stole it?
Impossible to break into Gringotts
the sword is there.
Mudblood / i
How did it get here then?
Nowhere is safer,
than in Gringotts bank.
Consider yourself lucky goblin
- This does not apply to her.
- You only think!
Expelliarmus / i
Stupefy! / i
Stop!
Drop your wands.
I said, drop them!

Stupefy! / i
Stupid elf!

Dobby never meant to kill .
Dobby only meant to maim or
seriously injure
How dare you take a
witch's wand?
How dare you
defy your masters?
Dobby has no master!
Dobby is a free elf...

Harry Potter and his friends
Hermione!
Are you alright?
We are safe.
We are all safe.
Harry Potter ...
Dobby!
That would be fine ...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on, yes?
We are going to fix it.
Hermione, the dittany ...
... in your purse!
Hermione!
Hermione!
Help me!
It's so beautiful than alone...
... with you here as friends.
Dobby is Happy ...
... that may be
with his friend ...
... Harry Potter.
We should close his eyes ...
... don't you think
There
Now he could be sleeping.
I want to bury him...
...Properly, without magic.
It's beautiful here.

It was our aunt's.

We used to come here as kids.

The Order uses it now as a safe house.

What's left of us atleast.

Muggles think these things keep evil away.

But they're wrong.

I need to talk to the Goblin.

How are you?

You buried the elf?

Yes.

And brought me here.

You are...

Pretty unusual, is it?

How did you come by the sword?

It's complicated.

Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think

that it should be in her vault at Gringotts?

It's complicated.

The sword presented itself to us,

in moment of need.

We didn't steal it.

There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault

identical to this one.

But it is a fake.

It was placed there this past summer.

And she never suspected it was a fake.

The replica is very convincing.

Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.

Who is the acquaintance?

A Hogwarts Professor.

As I understand that he's now Headmaster.

Snape.

He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.

Why?

There are more than a fewcurious things

in the vaults at Gringotts.

And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?

Perhaps.

I need to get into Gringotts.

Into one of the vaults.

It is impossible.

Alone, yes.

But with you, no.

Why should I help you?

I have gold.

Lots of...

I've no interest in gold.

Then what?

That.

That is my price.

Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?

Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.

She kept asking you,

what else was taken?

I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.

Another piece of his soul.

Let's find it, kill it, and we are

one step closer to killing him.

And what happens when we find it,

How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?

I'm still working on that part.

He's weak.

Who?

Mr. Ollivander

I need to ask you a few questions.

Anything, m'boy.

Anything!

Would you mind identifying this wand?

We need to know if it's safe to use.

Uhh... Walnut

Dragon Heartstring

Unyie...

Unyielding.

This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.

Treat it carefully.

And this?

Hawthorn.

An unicorn hair.

Reasonably pliant.

This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

Was?

Is it not still?

Well, perhaps not.

If you won it from him.

I sense its allegiance has changed.

You talk about wands,

as if they have feelings...

...can think!

The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.

That much has always been clear to

those of us who've studied wandlore.

And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?

It is rumored there are three.

The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,

to hide you from your enemies...

and the Resurrection Stone, to bring

back loved ones from the dead.

Together, they make one the Master of Death.

But, few truly believe that such objects exist.

Do you?

Do you believe they exist, sir?

Well...

I see no reasons to put

stock into an old wives' tale.

You're lying!

You know one exists.

You told him about it.

You told him about the Elder Wand...

and where he could go looking for it.

He tortured me.

Besides...

...I only conveyed rumors.

There's...

There's no telling whether he will find it.

He has found it, sir.

We'll let you rest.

He's after you, Mr. Potter.

If it's true what you say,

that he has the Elder Wand,

I'm afraid,

...you really don't stand a chance.

Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.

You're sure that's hers?

Positive.

Well?

How do I look?

Hideous.

You can give that to Hermione to hold.

Alright, Griphook?

We're relying on you, Griphook.

If you get us past the guards into the vault...

The sword's yours.

Madam Lestrange.

Good morning.

Good morning?

Good morning?

You're Bellatrix Lestrange,

not a school girl!

Hey!

Easy!

If she gives us away, we must swear

to use that sword to slit our own throats.

Understand?

No, he's right.

I speak stupid.

Okay.

Let's do it.

I wish to enter my vault.

Identification?

I hardly think that would be necessary.

Madam Lestrange.

I don't like to be kept waiting.

I know...

They know she's an impostor.

They'd be warned.

Harry...

What do we do, Harry?

Madam Lestrange,

would you mind presenting your wand?

And why should I do that?

It's the bank's policy!

I'm sure you understand, given current climate.

No! I most certainly do not understand!

I'm afraid, I must insist.

Imperio!

Very well, Madam Lestrange.

If you would follow me?

What is that, Griphook?

Griphook!

Aresto Momentum

Well done, Hermione.

Oh no, you two're like you again.

The Thief's Downfall,

washes away all enchantment.

Can be deadly.

You don't say.

Just out of interest,

is there any other way outta here?

No.

What the devil are all you doing down here?

Thieves!

You gave up the...

-Imperio

-You!

That doesn't sound good.

Bloody hell!

It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.

Here.

It's been trained to expect pain

when it hears this noise.

That's barbaric!

Lumos.

Blimey!

Accio Horcrux!

You seem you're gonna try

this here, won't you?

No kind of magic would work in here.

It's in here, Harry?

Can you feel anything?

That's it!

Up there!

They have added the Gemino curse.

Everything you touch will multiply.

Give me the sword.

Stop moving!

Do it!

We had deal, Griphook!

The cup for the sword!

I said I'll get you in,

I didn't say anything about getting you out.

Griphook! Thieves!

Griphook!

Hey, thieves!

Is that okay?

We've still got Bogrod.

That's unfortunate.

We can't just stand here,

You got any idea?

Should be a brilliant one.

I've got something,

but it's mad!

Reducto

Well, come on, then!

Relashio

Keep moving!

Now what?

Reducto

Hold on.

That was brilliant!

Absolutely brilliant!

We're dropping!

I say we jump!

When?

Now!

He knows.

You-Know-Who.

He knows we broke into Gringotts.

He knows what we took,

and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.

How did he know?

I saw him.

You let him in?

Harry, you can't do that!

Hermione, I can't always help it!

Well, maybe I can.

I don't know!

Never mind!

What happened?

Well, he's angry...

and scared too.

He knows, if we find and destroy

all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.

I reckon he'll stop at nothing

to make sure we don't find the rest.

And there's more.

One of them is at Hogwarts.

What?

You saw it?

I saw the castle.

And Rowena Ravenclaw.

It must have something to do with her.

We have to go there, now!

Well, we can't do that!

We've got to plan,

we've got to figure it out!

Hermione, when have any of

our plans ever actually worked?

We plan, we get there,

all hell breaks loose.

He's right!

One problem...

Snape's Headmaster now,

we can't just move freely from the front door!

Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,

to Honeydukes.

Take the secret passage in the cellar.

It's...

There's something wrong with him.

It's like, you know,

in the past...

I've always been able

to follow his thoughts.

And now everything just feels disconnected.

Maybe it's the Horcruxes.

Maybe he's getting weaker.

Maybe he's dying!

No!

No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.

If anything, he feels more dangerous.

Right here. Come on!

Search everywhere.

Go, move!

Faster!

In here, Potter.

Come on, move!

Did you look at him.

For a second I thought that was...

I know. Dumbledore!

Harry?

I can see you in this.

Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?

Have you any idea how dangerous it is?

You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.

It's you who I've been seeing in here.

You're the one who sent Dobby.

Why've you left him?

He's dead.

Sorry to hear it.

I liked that elf.

Who gave that to you?

The mirror?

Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.

Dung had no right selling that to you.

It belongs to...

Sirius...

Albus told me.

He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,

...if you ever found that I had it.

But, ask yourself;

Where would you be if I didn't?

Do you have any others much?

From the Order?

The Order has finished.

You-Know-Who has won,

...anyone who says otherwise

is killing themselves.

We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.

Dumbledore gave us a job to do.

Did he now...

Nice job?

Easy?

We've been hunting Horcruxes.

We think the last one's inside the castle.

But we'll need your help getting in.

Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.

Do yourself a favor, boy.

Go home!

Live a little longer.

Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.

What makes you think you can trust him?

What makes you think you can

believe anything my brother told you?

And in all the time you knew him...

Did he ever mention my name?

Did he ever mentioned hers?

Why should he...

Keep secrets.

You tell me?

I trusted him.

That's the boy's answer.

A boy goes chasing Horcruxes is on the word of

a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.

You're lying!

Not just on me, it doesn't matter.

To yourself as well.

That's what a fool does.

You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!

So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.

I'm not interested in what happened

between you and your brother.

I don't care that you've given up.

I trusted the man I knew.

We need to get into the castle tonight.

You know what to do.

Where have you sent her?

You'll see.

Soon enough.

That's your sister, Ariana.

Isn't it?

She died very young, didn't she?

My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.

On his journey to find power.

Including Ariana.

And she was devoted to him.

He gave her everything.

But time.

Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.

He did save our lives twice!

Kept an eye on us on that mirror.

That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!

She's coming back.

What's that with her?

Neville!

How you look...

Like hell, I reckon.

But this is nothing.

Seamus is worse.

Hey, Ab!

We've got a couple more coming through.

Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.

That's because it never existed till now.

The seven secret passages were sealed off,

before the start of the year.

This is the only way in or out, now.

The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.

How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?

Hardly ever seen.

It's the Carrows who's watching out for.

Carrows?

Yeah. Brother and sister.

Incharge of discipline.

They like punishment, the Carrows.

They did that to you?

Why?

Today's Dark Arts lesson was

practicing the Cruciatus curse.

On first years.

I refused.

Hogwarts has changed.

Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?

Hey, you lots! It's

for your surprise.

No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.

We'll be surprised if it's just digested.

Oh my!

Harry!

Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.

Okay, okay!

Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.

...Do you read? we've a new weather report.

Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.

What's the fun, Harry?

Okay.

There's something we need to find.

There's something hidden here, in the castle.

And it may help us to defeat

You-Know-Who.

Alright, what is it?

We don't know.

Where is it?

We don't know that either.

I realize that's not much to go on.

That's nothing to go on.

I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.

It'll be small, easily concealed.

Anyone, any ideas?

Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

Oh, bloody hell!

Here we go!

Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?

Hasn't anyone heard of it?

It's quite famous.

Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.

For centuries.

There's no person alive today who's seen it.

Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?

It's a sort of crown.

You know, like a tiara.

Harry!

Hi, there.

Six months she hasn't seen me and

it's like I'm a frankie first-year.

I'm her brother!

She got lots of them, but she has got only one Harry.

Shut up, Seamus!

What is it, Ginny?

Snape knows... he knows

that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.

Many of you are surely wondering,

why I have summoned you at this hour.

It's come to my attention,

that earlier this evening...

Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.

Now...

should anyone...

student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?

They will be punished in a manner consistent with

the severity of their transcription, further more...

Any person found have

knowledge of these events...

who fails to come forward...

will be treated as equally guilty.

Another...

If anyone in here has any knowledge of

Mr. Potter's movements this evening.

I invite them to step forward.

Now!

It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,

...you still have a security problem, Headmaster.

I'm afraid it's quite extensive.

How dare you stand where he stood?

Tell them how it happened that night?

Tell them how you looked him in the eye...

A man who trusted you, and killed him.

Tell them!

COWARD!

Harry.

Potter?

I know that many of you will want to fight.

Some of you might even think to fight is wise.

But this is folly.

Give me Harry Potter.

Do this and none shall be harmed.

Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.

Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.


You have one hour.

What're you waiting for?

Someone grab him!

Students out of bed!

Students in the corridor!

They're supposed to be out of bed,

you blithering idiot!

Sorry ma'am.

As it happens, Mr. Filch...

Your arrival is most opportune.

If you would, I wouldd like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson

and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.

Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?

The dungeons would do.

I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.

What is it you need?

Time, Professor.

As much as you can get me.

Do what you have to do.

I'll secure the castle.

Potter...

It's good to see you.

It's good to see you too, Professor.

Hold the fort, Neville.

Harry!

Hermione and I were thinking,

it doesn't matter if we find the Horcrux.

What do you mean?

Unless we can destroy it.

So, we were thinking...

Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.

It was completely brilliant

You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary

with a Basilisk fang, right?

Well, me and Hermione did remind

where we might find one.

Okay.

Okay, but take this.

That way, you can find me when you get back.

Where're you going?

Ravenclaw common room,

Gotta start somewhere.

Harry!

Harry!

Let me get this straight, Professor...

You're actually giving us

permission to do this?

That is correct, Longbottom.

That's blowing up!

Boom!

Boom!

Wicked!

But how on earth are we gonna do that?

Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?

As I recall, he has a particular

proclivity for pyro-technics.

I can bring it down.

That's the spirit!

Well, you go.

You do realize, of course, we can't

keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.

That doesn't mean

we can't delay him.

And his name is Voldemort.

Filius, you might as well use it.

He's come to try to kill you, either way!

Piertotum Locomotor.

Hogwarts is threatened.

Man the boundaries! Protect us.

Do your duty...

...to our school.

I always wanted to use that spell!

Protego Maxima

Fianto Duri

Repello Inimigotum

Protego Maxima

Fianto Duri

Repello...

Protego Maxima

Fianto Duri

Repello Inimigotum

Protego Maxima

Harry, wait!

I need to talk to you!

I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.

You don't know where you're going.

You're wasting your time!

Look, we'll talk later, okay?

Harry?

Later.

Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!

Do you remember what Cho said

about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?

There is not a person alive who's seen it.

It's obvious, isn't it?

We have to talk to someone who's dead.

It's very impressive, isn't it?

If you want to find her,

you'll find her down there.

Aren't you coming?

No.

I think it's best if you two talk alone.

She's very shy.

You're the Grey Lady.

The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.

I do not answer to that name!

No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

It's Helena, isn't it?

Helena Ravenclaw,

Rowena's daughter.

Are you a friend of Luna's?

Yes.

And she thought you might be able to help me.

You seek my mother's diadem?

Yes.

That's right.

Luna is kind.

Unlike so many of the others.

But she was wrong,

I cannot help you!

Wait, please!

I want to destroy it!

They never learn.

Such a pity.

My Lord...

Shouldn't we wait?

Begin!

I thought you want to do it.

Isn't it, Helena?

You want it destroyed?

Another promised

to destroy it many years ago.

A strange boy with a strange name?

Tom Riddle.

But he lied.

He lied to many people.

I know what he's done!

I know who he is!

He defiled it, with dark magic!

I can destroy it.

Once and for all.

But only if you tell me

where he hid it?

You do know where he hid it?

Don't you, Helena?

You just have to tell me.

Please!

Strange!

You remind me of him a bit.

It's here, in the castle.

In the place where everything is hidden.

If you have to ask...

...you will never know.

If you know...

...you need only ask.

Thank you!

Tell Professor McGonagall.

Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.

Yes, sir!

Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we

might need one or two more wands this side.

It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..

...not the number of followers.

Who said that?

Me.

You okay, Freddie?

Yeah.

Me too.

Harry talks this in sleep.

You know it?

No, of course, not!

Yeah?

You-Know-Who's army?

You do it.

I can't.

Yes, you can!

Neville!

That went well.

Get inside!

Stupefy

Ginny, Neville!

You alright?

Never better!

I feel like I can spit fire!

Have you seen Luna up there?

Luna?

I'm mad for her. I think it�s about time I told her

since we�ll probably both be dead by dawn.

I know.

Bloody hell!

We'll never find him on this.

Here he is!

He's just...

Brilliant!

He just vanished.

I'm sure I saw it.

Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.

It doesn't show up on the map, does it?

You said that last year.

That's right, I did.

Let's go.

Brilliant!

Come on!

Well, well...

What brings you here, Potter?

I could ask you the same.

You have something that's mine.

I'd like it back.

What's wrong with the wand you have?

It's my mother's.

It's powerful, but it's...

..not the same.

Doesn't quite understand me.

You know what I mean?

Why didn't you tell her?

Bellatrix?

You knew it was me.

You didn't say anything.

Come on, Draco!

Don't be a prat.

Do it!

Easy!

Expelliarmus

Avada Kedavra

Stupefy

This is my girlfriend,

you bloody gits!

Got it!

They've set the bloody place on fire!

Come on!

This way!

We can't leave them!

He's joking, right?

If we die for them,

Harry, I'm gonna kill you!

Harry!

My Lord?

Avada Kedavra!

Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.

It's the snake.

She's the last one.

It's the last Horcrux.

Look inside him, Harry.

Find out where he is,

if you find him, we can find the snake.

And we can end this!

My Lord...

Might it be less...

I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.

Simply seek the boy.

Yourself.

I do not need to seek the boy...

...before the night is out, he will come to me!

Do you understand?

Look at me!

How can you live with yourself, Lucius?

I don't know.

Go and find Severus.

Bring him to me.

I know where he is.

Come on!

No!

You have performed extra-ordinary magic

with this wand, My Lord,

in the last few hours alone.

No!

No! I am extra-ordinary.

But the wand resists me .

There is no wand more powerful.

Ollivander himself has said it.

Tonight, when the boy comes.

It will not fail you, I am sure ...

It answers to you,

and you only.

Does it?

My Lord?

The wand, does it truly

answer to me?

You're a clever man, Severus.

Surely you must know...

Where does its true loyalty lie?

With you...

Of course, My Lord.

The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,

because I am not its true master.

The Elder Wand belongs to the

wizard who killed its last owner.

You killed Dumbledore, Severus.

While you live, the Elder

Wand cannot truly be mine.

You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.

But only I can live forever.

My Lord...

Nagini, kill!

Take it...

Take it up, please!

Give me something!

Quickly, a flask. Anything!

Take them to the Pensieve.

Look at me...

You really have your mother's eyes.

You've fought valiantly,

but in vain...

I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood

spilled is a terrible waste.

I therefore command my forces to retreat...

In their absence,

dispose your dead with dignity,

Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.

On this night, you have allowed your friends to die

for you, rather than face me yourself.

There is no greater dishonor.

Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...

...and confront your fate.

If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,

woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.

Where's everybody?

Harry?

Oh, come on!

Don't be sad on it, she's passed.

There, she's gone.

Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!

You're freak!

You're freak, Lily!

Come here!

She's jealous.

She's ordinary and you're special.

That's not true, Severus.

Gryffindor!

Hi, I'm James.

Hi, I'm Lily.

Just like your father.

Don't say a word against my father!

Masters shall be reunited once more!

Severus.

Don't kill me!

The prophecy did not refer to a woman.

It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.

Yes, but it's her son!

He intends to hunt them down and kill them.

Hide him... hide them all.

I beg you!

What would you give me in exchange, Severus?

Anything.

Harry...

Harry, you were so loved.

So loved!

Harry, mama loves you.

Dadda loves you.

Harry, be safe.

Be strong.

Avada Kedavra!

You said you would keep her safe.

Lily and James...

put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.

Rather like you.

The boy survives.

He doesn't need protection,

the Dark Lord has gone.

The Dark Lord will return.

And when he does, the boy

will be in terrible danger!

He has her eyes.

If you truly loved her...

No one, can know.

I shall never reveal the best of you,

Severus.

Your word?

Can you risk your life every day

to protect the boy?

... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame...

Don't tell a word against my father!

James Potter, lazy, arrogant.

My father was a great man!

Your father was a swine!

Drink it, it will contain the curse to

your hand, for the time being.

It will spread, Albus.

How long?

Maybe a year.

Don't ignore me, Severus.

We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered

the Malfoy boy to murder me.

But should he fail, I should presume

the Dark Lord will turn to you.

You must be the one to kill me, Severus.

It is the only way.

Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.

There will come a time, when Harry Potter,

must be told something.

But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.

Must be told what?

On the night Lord Voldemort went

to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...

Then, Lily Potter cast herself between them...

...the curse rebounded.

When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...

latched itself onto the only living thing it could find...

Harry himself.

There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...

There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...

A part of Voldemort lives inside him.

So, when the time comes...

...the boy must die?

Yes... yes.

He must die.

You've kept him alive, so he can

die at the proper moment?

You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.

Don't tell me now, that you've

grown to care for the boy.

Expecto Patronum

Lily!

After all this time!

Always.

So, when the time comes...

...the boy must die?

Yes.

He must die.

And Voldemort himself must do it.

That is essential.

Where've you been?

I thought you went to the forest.

I'm going there now.

Are you mad?

No...

You can't give yourself up to him.

What is it, Harry?

What is it you know?

There is a reason I can hear them.

The Horcruxes.

I think I've known for a while.

And I think you have, too.

I'll go with you.

No, kill the snake.

Kill the snake, and it's just him!

I'm ready to die.

Resurrection Stone.

You've been so brave, sweetheart.

Why are you here?

All of you.

We never left.

Does...

Does it hurt?

Dying?

Quicker than falling asleep.

You're nearly there, son.

I'm sorry.

I never wanted any of you to die for me.

And, Remus, your son?

Others will tell him what his

mother and father died for.

One day, he'll understand.

You'll stay with me?

Until the end.

And he won't be able to see you?

No.

We're here, you see.

Stay close to me.

Always.

No sign of him, My Lord.

I thought he'd come.

Harry, no!

What're yeh doin' 'ere?

Quiet!

Harry Potter...

...The Boy Who Lived...

...come to die.

Avada Kedavra

You can't help...

Harry, you're a wonderful boy...

You brave, brave man!

Let us walk.

Professor, what is that?

Something beyond either of our help.

A part of Voldemort sent here to die.

And exactly where are we?

I was gonna ask you that.

Where would you say where we are?

Well, it looks like King's Cross station.

Only cleaner...

...and without all the trains.

King's Cross, is that right?

This is as they say, 'your' party.

I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...

...have been connected by something other than fate.

Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.

So it's true then, sir.

A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?

Did.

It's been just destroyed many moments

ago by none other than Voldemort himself.

You, were the Horcrux he

never meant to make, Harry.

I have to go back, haven't I?

Oh, that's up to you.

I've a choice?

Oh, yeah!

We're in King's Cross, you say.

I think if so decide,

you'll be able to board a train.

And where will it take me?

On.

Voldemort has the Elder Wand?

True.

And the snake is still alive?

Yes.

And I've nothing to kill it with?

Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.

To those who ask for it.

I've always pride of myself

on my ability to turn a phrase.

Words are, in my not so humble opinion...

..almost inexhaustible source of magic.

Capable of inflicting

injury and remedies.

But I would in this case...

amend my original statement to this:

Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,

To those who deserve it.

Do not pity the dead, Harry...

Pity the living.

And above all...

...all those who live without love.

Professor, my mother's Patronus...

was a doe, wasn't it?

As the same as Professor Snape's.

It's curious, don't you think?

Actually, if I think about it...

...it doesn't seem curious at all!

I'll be going now, Harry.

Professor?

Is this all real?

Or is it just happening inside my head?

Of course it's happening

inside your head, Harry.

Why should that mean, that it's not real?

Professor?

What should I do?

Professor!

My Lord, My Lord...

Are you hurt?

I don't need your help.

The boy...

Is he dead?

Is he alive?

Draco, is he alive?

Dead.

Who is that?

Hagrid's carrying?

Neville, who is it?

Harry Potter...

... is dead!

No!

No!

Silence!

Stupid girl!

Harry Potter...

is dead!

From this day forth...

...you'll put your faith in me.

Harry Potter is dead!

And now it's the time to declare yourself.

Come forward and join us...

or die!

Draco!

Draco.

Draco.

Come.

Well done, Draco.

Well done!

Well, I must say I'd hope for better.

And who might you be, young man?

Neville Longbottom.

Well, Neville, I'm sure we can

find a place for you in our rank.

I'd like to say something.

Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be

fascinated to hear what you have to say.

Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.

Stand down, Neville!

People die everyday!

Friends, family.

Yeah...

We lost Harry tonight.

He's still with us.

In here.

So as Fred, Remus...

Tonks...

All of them.

They didn't die in vain.

But you will.

Because you're wrong!

Harry's heart did beat for us.

For all of us!

It's not over!

Confringo

Come on!

All remain into the castle.

We have to kill the snake.

Hey, Neville!

Not my daughter, you bitch!

Hey, you were right...

...when you told Professor Snape

that wand was failing you.

It was always fail...

I killed Snape!

Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?

What if its allegiance has always been

with someone else?

Oh, come on, Tom...

Let's finish it the way we started.

Together!

Die!

Harry!

[after war is finally won and Voldemort has been killed]
Why didn't it work for him?

The Elder Wand?

It answers to somebody else.

When he killed Snape, he thought

the wand would become his.

But the thing is...

The wand never belongs to Snape.

It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore

that night in the Astronomy tower.

From that moment on, the wand answered him.

Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.

At Malfoy Manor.

So, that means...

It's mine!

What should we do with it?

We?

Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.

The most powerful wand in the world.

With that, he'll be invincible.

[Harry snaps the wand in half and throws the pieces over the edge of the bridge]
Together.

Bag?

Yeah

Jumper?

I'm gonna miss you.

Here they come.

[last lines; 19 years later Harry and Ginny now married take their children to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters to board Hogwarts Express]
Albus Severus Potter: Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?
Harry Potter: Albus Severus Potter, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was the bravest man I’d ever known.
Albus Severus Potter: But just say that I am.
Harry Potter: Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful young wizard. But listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
Albus Severus Potter: Really?
Harry Potter: Really.
[the train warden sounds his whistle for everyone to board the train]
Harry Potter: Ready?
Albus Severus Potter: Ready.
[Harry hugs his son, then Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny watch as their children depart for school on the Hogwarts Express]
