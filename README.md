### About

TAU Cambridge(UK) is building an android app, â€œTAU - phone mining".

It enables phones to form up independent blockchains for ditigal coins circulation, so that individuals can freely operate payment and finance business in a community. In the core, we develop a server-less communication protocol with all source open. Without hosting fee, the only cost for user is the data transmission. We pay particular attention to save data consumption and tailor it to be useful in expensive data region.
